Step 1:
Image Description: A bowl of basmati rice is being washed under running water, with the grains submerged and swirling in the water. The clean rice is then soaked in water, the grains becoming slightly translucent as they begin to absorb moisture.
Action: Wash and soak 2 cups of basmati rice in water for 30 minutes *

Step 2:
Image Description: The soaked rice is boiling in a pot of salted water. The grains have expanded slightly and are soft but still firm to the touch. The rice is being drained in a colander, ready to be set aside.
Action: Boil the soaked rice in salted water until it’s 70% cooked, then drain and set aside *

Step 3:
Image Description: A large pot is heating up with oil. The oil spreads out into a glossy, thin layer at the bottom of the pot.
Action: Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large pot *

Step 4:
Image Description: Thin slices of onion are being sautéed in the hot oil, gradually turning golden brown. The onions are softening and caramelizing, giving off a sweet, savory aroma.
Action: Add 1 large sliced onion and sauté until golden brown *

Step 5:
Image Description: A tablespoon of ginger-garlic paste is added to the golden onions. The paste sizzles in the oil, releasing a fragrant aroma as it’s stirred into the mixture.
Action: Add 1 tablespoon of ginger-garlic paste and sauté until the raw smell disappears *

Step 6:
Image Description: Chopped tomatoes are added to the pan, mixing with the onion and ginger-garlic paste. The tomatoes soften as they cook, becoming mushy and blending into the mixture to form a thick base.
Action: Add 2 medium-sized tomatoes (chopped) and cook until they turn mushy *

Step 7:
Image Description: Sliced chicken pieces are added to the tomato-onion mixture. The chicken begins to cook, turning white on the outside while absorbing the flavors of the base.
Action: Add sliced chicken pieces (500g) and cook for a few minutes until they are white on the outside *

Step 8:
Image Description: Plain yogurt is poured into the pot, along with bright yellow turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. The spices and yogurt mix into the chicken, creating a vibrant, creamy sauce.
Action: Add 1 cup of plain yogurt, 1 teaspoon of turmeric powder, 1 teaspoon of red chili powder, and salt to taste *

Step 9:
Image Description: The chicken is simmering in the spiced yogurt mixture, becoming tender as the masala thickens. The sauce is now rich and flavorful, coating the chicken evenly.
Action: Cook the chicken until it’s tender and the masala is thick *

Step 10:
Image Description: Half of the partially cooked rice is layered over the thick chicken masala in the pot. The rice forms a soft, fluffy layer, covering the masala base.
Action: Layer half of the partially cooked rice over the chicken masala in the pot *

Step 11:
Image Description: A sprinkling of finely chopped fresh mint and coriander leaves is added over the rice layer. The green herbs add a burst of color and fragrance, ready to infuse the biryani.
Action: Sprinkle finely chopped mint and coriander leaves over the rice layer *

Step 12:
Image Description: The remaining half of the cooked rice is spread evenly over the mint and coriander, forming a second rice layer that fully covers the chicken masala and herbs beneath.
Action: Add the remaining rice on top to fully cover the previous layers *

Step 13:
Image Description: Saffron-infused milk or yellow food coloring mixed with warm milk is drizzled over the top layer of rice. The milk creates bright orange-yellow streaks, giving the biryani a rich color and added flavor.
Action: Pour a few tablespoons of saffron milk or yellow food color mixed in warm milk over the top layer of rice *

Step 14:
Image Description: The pot is covered with a tight-fitting lid, trapping the steam inside. The biryani is cooking on low heat, allowing the flavors to blend.
Action: Cover the pot with a tight lid and cook on low heat (dum) for 20-25 minutes *

Step 15:
Image Description: The pot is removed from the heat and left undisturbed for 10 minutes. The biryani inside continues to steam gently, ensuring all the layers are fully cooked and the flavors are infused.
Action: Turn off the heat and let it sit for another 10 minutes undisturbed *

Step 16:
Image Description: The lid is removed, and the biryani is gently fluffed with a fork, separating the rice grains. The vibrant, fragrant chicken biryani is ready to be served hot, with a garnish of fresh herbs and a side of raita.
Action: Gently fluff up the rice with a fork and serve the chicken biryani hot with raita *
