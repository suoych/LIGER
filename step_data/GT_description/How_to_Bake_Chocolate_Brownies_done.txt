Step 1:
Image Description: A sleek silver oven door, with the display showing the temperature set to 350°F. The oven racks inside are visible, clean and empty, with a soft warm light reflecting from the preheating process.
Action: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) *

Step 2:
Image Description: A shiny 9x13-inch baking pan is being lightly greased with butter or oil, creating a thin, even layer across the smooth surface. The pan gleams slightly, ready to prevent the batter from sticking.
Action: Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan *

Step 3:
Image Description: A large mixing bowl contains melted butter, golden and slightly glossy, blending with white granulated sugar. As the ingredients mix together, the sugar begins to dissolve, creating a thick, grainy mixture with a pale yellow hue.
Action: In a mixing bowl, combine 1 cup melted butter and 2 cups sugar *

Step 4:
Image Description: Four eggs are cracked, one by one, into the butter and sugar mixture. The glossy egg yolks and whites blend into the mixture, making it smoother and more golden with each addition. The texture becomes thicker and creamier as the eggs are fully incorporated.
Action: Add 4 large eggs, one at a time, stirring well after each addition *

Step 5:
Image Description: A small stream of dark amber vanilla extract is poured into the smooth, creamy mixture. As it’s stirred in, the batter becomes slightly more fragrant and darker in color, with the vanilla evenly blending throughout.
Action: Stir in 1 teaspoon vanilla extract *

Step 6:
Image Description: In a second bowl, fine cocoa powder and white flour are combined with small mounds of salt and baking powder. The mixture appears dry and powdery, with the dark cocoa powder contrasting against the pale flour. A whisk blends everything into a uniform, light brown mixture.
Action: In a separate bowl, combine 1/2 cup cocoa powder, 1 cup flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon baking powder *

Step 7:
Image Description: The dry cocoa-flour mixture is being spooned into the wet butter and egg mixture, a little at a time. As it’s stirred in, the batter thickens and turns into a rich, dark brown color with a smooth, slightly glossy texture. The ingredients are fully incorporated, forming a thick brownie batter.
Action: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring until well combined *

Step 8:
Image Description: The thick, chocolatey brownie batter is being poured into the greased 9x13-inch pan. The batter is dense and smooth, spreading evenly as it fills the pan. A spatula is used to gently level the top, creating a flat, even surface.
Action: Pour the batter into the greased baking pan *

Step 9:
Image Description: The filled baking pan is carefully placed on the center rack inside the preheated oven. The batter is smooth and dark, with the oven’s light reflecting off the glossy surface as the brownies begin to bake.
Action: Place the pan in the preheated oven *

Step 10:
Image Description: Inside the oven, the brownie batter has risen slightly, forming a smooth, crackly surface. The edges have set, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, signaling the brownies are fully baked. The top has a soft, slightly glossy sheen.
Action: Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean *

Step 11:
Image Description: The brownies, now cooled, have a firm, crackly top with slightly raised edges. The surface is a rich, dark chocolate color. A knife cuts smoothly through the soft, fudgy center, dividing the brownies into neat squares ready to be served.
Action: Allow the brownies to cool in the pan before cutting into squares and serving *
