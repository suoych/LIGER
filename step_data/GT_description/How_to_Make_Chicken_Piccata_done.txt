Step 1:
Image Description: Raw chicken breasts are laid out on a surface and sprinkled with salt and freshly cracked black pepper. The seasoning lightly dusts the chicken, which looks plump and ready for the next step.
Action: Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper *

Step 2:
Image Description: The chicken breasts are being dredged in a shallow dish of flour. The flour coats each piece lightly, with excess flour being shaken off, leaving a thin, even layer of white powder over the chicken.
Action: Dredge the chicken breasts in flour, shaking off excess flour *

Step 3:
Image Description: A large skillet sits on the stove with olive oil shimmering as it heats over medium-high heat. The oil is glossy and slightly bubbling, ready to cook the chicken.
Action: In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat *

Step 4:
Image Description: The flour-coated chicken breasts are sizzling in the hot skillet. The surface of the chicken is turning golden brown, with a crispy crust forming as they cook per side.
Action: Add the chicken breasts and cook until golden brown on both sides, about 3-4 minutes per side *

Step 5:
Image Description: The golden brown chicken breasts are being removed and set aside on a plate. They are cooked to a perfect, crispy exterior while the inside remains tender.
Action: Remove the chicken breasts from the skillet and set aside *

Step 6:
Image Description: Minced garlic is added to the remaining oil in the skillet. The garlic sizzles and releases a fragrant aroma as it cooks, slightly browning but not burning.
Action: In the same skillet, add minced garlic and cook for about 30 seconds *

Step 7:
Image Description: Chicken broth and freshly squeezed lemon juice are poured into the skillet, mixing with the garlic. A wooden spoon scrapes the browned bits from the bottom of the skillet, incorporating them into the sauce, giving it extra flavor.
Action: Pour in chicken broth and lemon juice, scrapping up any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet *

Step 8:
Image Description: Small green capers are added to the skillet. They float in the bubbling broth and lemon juice, adding a sharp, briny touch as the sauce comes to a rapid boil.
Action: Add capers and bring the sauce to a boil *

Step 9:
Image Description: The sauce in the skillet has reduced to a simmer, with small bubbles forming around the capers and garlic. The liquid thickens slightly as it cooks.
Action: Reduce the heat and let the sauce simmer for about 5 minutes *

Step 10:
Image Description: The cooked chicken breasts are returned to the skillet, nestling into the simmering sauce. The chicken absorbs the flavors of the broth, lemon, and capers as it heats through.
Action: Return the cooked chicken breasts to the skillet and simmer for another 5 minutes, until the chicken is heated through *

Step 11:
Image Description: The chicken breasts are placed on individual plates, and a spoon is used to ladle the lemony, caper-filled sauce over the top of each piece. The sauce glistens over the golden brown chicken, adding extra flavor.
Action: Transfer the chicken to plates and spoon the sauce over the top *

Step 12:
Image Description: Freshly chopped parsley is sprinkled over the plated chicken, adding a pop of green color and a bright, herbal flavor. The dish is ready to be served immediately, warm and fragrant.
