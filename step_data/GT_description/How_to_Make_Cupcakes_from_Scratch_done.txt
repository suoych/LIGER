Step 1:
Image Description: A clean, empty muffin tin is neatly lined with white cupcake liners, ready for batter. The oven temperature is set to 350°F (175°C), and the digital display shows the preheating process. The shiny, metallic surface of the muffin tin contrasts with the soft paper liners.
Action: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a muffin tin with cupcake liners *

Step 2:
Image Description: A large mixing bowl holds a pale, dry mixture of flour, baking powder, and salt. The fine, white flour is mixed with small grains of baking powder, and the salt is finely dispersed throughout the dry ingredients, creating a smooth, light powder.
Action: In a mixing bowl, combine 1 1/2 cups of flour, 1 1/2 tsp of baking powder, and 1/4 tsp of salt *

Step 3:
Image Description: In another mixing bowl, softened unsalted butter and granulated sugar are being beaten together with an electric mixer. The butter is pale yellow, and the sugar is bright white. As they are creamed together, the mixture turns light and fluffy with a soft, smooth texture.
Action: In another bowl, cream together 1/2 cup of unsalted butter and 1 cup of sugar until light and fluffy *

Step 4:
Image Description: Two eggs are being cracked and added, one at a time, into the bowl with the butter and sugar mixture. After each addition, the electric mixer blends the eggs into the mixture, making it richer and smoother. The batter becomes a soft, pale yellow with a glossy sheen.
Action: Add 2 eggs to the butter mixture, one at a time, beating well after each addition *

Step 5:
Image Description: A small bottle of vanilla extract is tipped, and dark brown vanilla liquid pours into the creamy mixture. As it’s blended, the vanilla mixes evenly into the batter, adding a subtle, rich fragrance and deepening the flavor.
Action: Mix in 2 tsp of vanilla extract *

Step 6:
Image Description: The dry flour mixture is gradually added to the butter mixture, alternating with small amounts of milk. The batter is thick and smooth, with each addition of milk making it lighter. The ingredients blend seamlessly, forming a creamy, consistent batter with no lumps.
Action: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, alternating with 1/2 cup of milk, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients *

Step 7:
Image Description: A spoon or scoop is used to carefully pour the cupcake batter into the lined muffin tin. Each liner is filled about two-thirds full, with the smooth, pale batter sitting neatly inside.
Action: Pour the batter into the cupcake liners, filling each about 2/3 full *

Step 8:
Image Description: The muffin tin is placed in the preheated oven, and the batter begins to rise as it bakes. The tops of the cupcakes are doming slightly, turning a light golden brown. A toothpick is inserted into the center of one, coming out clean, indicating they are fully baked.
Action: Bake in the preheated oven for 18-20 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean *

Step 9:
Image Description: The freshly baked cupcakes are still in the muffin tin, their tops golden brown and slightly domed. They are cooling on the stovetop, with a warm, inviting aroma filling the air. 
Action: Remove the cupcakes from the oven and let them cool in the tin for about 5 minutes *

Step 10:
Image Description: The slightly cooled cupcakes are transferred from the muffin tin to a wire cooling rack. The tops are golden and firm, while the sides are soft and fluffy. The cupcakes are spaced evenly on the rack.
Action: Transfer the cupcakes to a wire rack to cool completely before frosting *
