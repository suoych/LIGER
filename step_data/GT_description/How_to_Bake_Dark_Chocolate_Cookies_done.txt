Step 1:
Image Description: A sleek silver oven door, with the display showing the temperature set to 350°F. The oven racks inside are visible, clean and empty, with a soft warm light reflecting from the preheating process.
Action: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) *

Step 2:
Image Description: A large mixing bowl holds dark cocoa powder, white granulated sugar, and glossy vegetable oil. The cocoa powder is deep and rich in color, contrasting with the bright white sugar. The oil glistens on top, making the mixture appear ready to blend together.
Action: In a large bowl, combine 1 cup of unsweetened dark cocoa powder, 2 cups of sugar, and 1/2 cup of vegetable oil *

Step 3:
Image Description: Four eggs are cracked one at a time into the bowl, and a mixer is blending them with the cocoa, sugar, and oil mixture. With each egg, the batter becomes smoother, turning a shiny, dark chocolate color and gradually thickening into a rich consistency.
Action: Add 4 eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition *

Step 4:
Image Description: A small stream of dark brown vanilla extract is poured into the chocolate batter. As it is stirred in, the batter becomes even more aromatic and glossy, with the vanilla blending seamlessly into the rich chocolate mixture.
Action: Stir in 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract *

Step 5:
Image Description: A separate bowl holds white all-purpose flour, small mounds of baking powder, and fine salt. The dry ingredients are whisked together, forming a light, airy, pale mixture with a smooth consistency.
Action: In another bowl, whisk together 2 cups of all-purpose flour, 2 teaspoons of baking powder, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt *

Step 6:
Image Description: The dry flour mixture is being spooned into the chocolate batter a little at a time. As the ingredients are mixed together, the batter becomes thicker, with a dense, smooth texture. The flour blends in completely, leaving no visible streaks.
Action: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the chocolate mixture and mix until just combined *

Step 7:
Image Description: A cup of dark chocolate chips is being folded into the thick chocolate dough. The chips glisten against the dark batter, evenly distributed throughout, adding texture and extra richness to the dough.
Action: Fold in 1 cup of dark chocolate chips *

Step 8:
Image Description: Rounded spoonfuls of the rich, dark chocolate cookie dough are placed onto an ungreased baking sheet. Each mound of dough is thick and glossy, spaced evenly with about 2 inches between each to allow room for spreading as they bake.
Action: Drop spoonfuls of dough onto ungreased baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart *

Step 9:
Image Description: The cookies are baking in the oven, rising slightly and spreading out. The edges of the cookies are starting to set and turn slightly crisp, while the centers remain soft and slightly puffed. The dark chocolate chips have melted slightly, creating small shiny spots on the surface.
Action: Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are set *

Step 10:
Image Description: The freshly baked cookies are resting on the baking sheet, cooling slightly. The edges are firm and set, while the centers remain soft. A few chocolate chips are still melted, creating glossy pools. After a few minutes, the cookies are carefully transferred to a wire rack, where they cool completely, revealing their chewy, rich texture.
Action: Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely *
