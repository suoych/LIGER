Step 1:
Image Description: A ribeye steak, slightly marbled with fat, is being removed from its packaging and placed on a counter. The steak is thick and raw, with a fresh, red color, still slightly cold from the refrigerator.
Action: Remove the ribeye steak from the refrigerator *

Step 2:
Image Description: The ribeye steak is generously seasoned with coarse salt and cracked black pepper. The seasoning is spread evenly across both sides of the meat, adding texture and a light crust of spices on the surface.
Action: Season the steak with salt and pepper *

Step 3:
Image Description: An empty metal pan is placed on the stovetop, visibly hot with light steam rising from its surface. The pan has a clean, shiny surface that is heating up rapidly on high heat.
Action: Preheat a pan on high heat *

Step 4:
Image Description: A small amount of oil is poured into the hot pan. The oil shimmers immediately, spreading out in a thin, glossy layer across the bottom of the pan, creating a slick surface for cooking.
Action: Add oil to the pan *

Step 5:
Image Description: The seasoned ribeye steak is placed into the hot, oiled pan. The steak sizzles on contact, with the edges starting to sear, and a slight golden-brown crust begins to form on the underside.
Action: Place the steak in the pan *

Step 6:
Image Description: The ribeye steak is sizzling in the pan, cooking on one side. The surface of the steak is browning and caramelizing, with some fat rendering and creating a golden crust along the edges.
Action: Cook the steak for 4-5 minutes on one side *

Step 7:
Image Description: The steak is flipped over with a pair of tongs, revealing a perfectly seared, caramelized crust on the cooked side. The uncooked side is now starting to sizzle as it makes contact with the hot pan.
Action: Flip the steak to cook on the other side *

Step 8:
Image Description: The steak is continuing to cook on the second side. The golden-brown crust is forming on both sides, and juices are beginning to pool slightly on top of the steak.
Action: Cook for another 4-5 minutes or to desired doneness *

Step 9:
Image Description: The ribeye steak is removed from the pan and placed on a cutting board to rest. The steak is slightly crisp on the outside with a beautifully seared crust, while juices pool on the surface as it rests.
Action: Remove the steak from the pan and let it rest *
