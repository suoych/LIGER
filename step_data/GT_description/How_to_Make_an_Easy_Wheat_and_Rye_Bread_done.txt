Step 4:

Image Description: Yeast are sprinkled into the flour and water mixture, beginning the leavening process to help the dough rise.
Action: Sprinkle 2 1/4 teaspoons (1 packet) of yeast into the mixture. *

Step 5:

Image Description: The mixture is stirred with a wooden spoon or spatula until the ingredients come together to form a cohesive dough, slightly sticky.
Action: Stir the mixture until it forms a cohesive dough. *

Step 6:

Image Description: The dough is kneaded on a floured surface, becoming smooth and elastic as it develops gluten.
Action: Knead the dough for about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic. *

Step 7:

Image Description: The kneaded dough is placed in a lightly oiled bowl, covered with a damp cloth, and left to rise. The dough begins to double in size as it proofs.
Action: Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise for 1 hour or until doubled in size. *

Step 8:

Image Description: The risen dough is punched down gently to release the trapped air, deflating it slightly and preparing it for shaping.
Action: Punch down the dough to release the air. *

Step 9:

Image Description: The dough is shaped into a loaf and placed in a greased loaf pan.
Action: Shape the dough into a loaf and place it into a greased loaf pan. *

Step 10:

Image Description: The loaf pan is covered and set aside, allowing the dough to rise again, becoming puffy and light.
Action: Cover the pan and let the dough rise for another 30 minutes. *

Step 11:

Image Description: The oven is preheated to 375째F (190째C), reaching the correct temperature to bake the bread to a golden brown.
