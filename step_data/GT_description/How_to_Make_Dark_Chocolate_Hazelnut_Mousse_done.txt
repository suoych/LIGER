Step 1:
Image Description: A small pile of 100g of dark chocolate is chopped into small, uneven pieces. The chocolate is rich and glossy, with sharp, defined edges from the chopping. The pieces are scattered in a heatproof bowl.
Action: Chop 100g of dark chocolate into small pieces and place them in a heatproof bowl *

Step 2:
Image Description: A small saucepan is heating 1/2 cup of cream until small bubbles form around the edges, indicating itâ€™s just simmering. The cream is being poured over the chopped dark chocolate in the bowl, covering the chocolate completely. The cream is steaming slightly as it hits the chocolate pieces.
Action: Heat 1/2 cup of cream in a small saucepan until just simmering and pour it over the chocolate *

Step 3:
Image Description: The bowl of chocolate and hot cream sits undisturbed for a moment. After a minute, a spoon is stirring the mixture. The chocolate gradually melts into the cream, becoming thick, smooth, and glossy as the two ingredients combine into a velvety chocolate mixture.
Action: Let it sit for a minute, then stir until the chocolate is completely melted and smooth *

Step 4:
Image Description: In a separate bowl, 1 cup of heavy cream is being whipped with a whisk or electric mixer. The cream turns from a liquid to soft, airy peaks, which hold their shape when the whisk is lifted. The whipped cream has a light, fluffy texture.
Action: In a separate bowl, whip 1 cup of heavy cream until soft peaks form *

Step 5:
Image Description: The bowl of soft whipped cream is gently folded into the smooth, melted chocolate mixture. The whipped cream is light and airy, while the chocolate is rich and smooth. As the two are combined, the mousse becomes light and creamy with a soft, chocolatey texture.
Action: Gently fold the whipped cream into the chocolate mixture until fully incorporated *

Step 6:
Image Description: The rich, dark chocolate mousse is carefully spooned into individual serving glasses. The mousse has a thick, creamy consistency and sits evenly in each glass. The glasses are then placed in the refrigerator to chill, allowing the mousse to set.
Action: Divide the mousse into serving glasses and refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving *

Step 7:
Image Description: The chilled dark chocolate mousse is garnished with finely chopped hazelnuts, scattered on top of each glass. The nuts add a crunchy texture and a subtle nutty flavor, contrasting with the smooth mousse. 
Action: Garnish with chopped hazelnuts before serving *
