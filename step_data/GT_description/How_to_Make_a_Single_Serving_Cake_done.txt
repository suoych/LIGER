Step 1:

Image Description: A microwave-safe mug with 4 tablespoons of fine, white all-purpose flour inside. The flour sits loosely at the bottom of the mug, slightly heaped, with a smooth, powdery texture.
Action: In a microwave-safe mug, combine 4 tablespoons of all-purpose flour. *

Step 2:

Image Description: The mug now contains both flour and 2 tablespoons of sugar. The sugar, with its fine, crystalline texture, is sprinkled on top of the flour, forming a visible layer of small, white granules.
Action: Add 2 tablespoons of sugar. *

Step 3:

Image Description: A half teaspoon of baking powder has been added to the mug. The baking powder forms a small, fluffy mound on top of the flour and sugar mixture, blending in with the other dry ingredients.
Action: Add 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder. *

Step 4:

Image Description: Three tablespoons of milk are poured into the mug, sinking into the dry ingredients. The milk begins to absorb into the flour, sugar, and baking powder, slightly changing the consistency.
Action: Stir in 3 tablespoons of milk. *

Step 5:

Image Description: Two tablespoons of vegetable oil are added to the mug. The oil forms small golden pools on the surface of the flour mixture, starting to combine with the other ingredients.
Action: Add 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil. *

Step 6:

Image Description: The ingredients in the mug are mixed together until they form a smooth, creamy batter. The batter has no visible lumps, and the mixture is thick and glossy.
Action: Mix everything together until the batter is smooth. *

Step 7:

Image Description: A few drops of vanilla extract are stirred into the smooth batter, leaving a subtle swirl of color before fully mixing in. The batter takes on a richer aroma and a slightly deeper hue.
Action: Stir in a few drops of vanilla extract. *

Step 8:

Image Description: The mug is in the microwave, and the batter has risen, forming a soft, fluffy cake. The cake has a slightly golden top and fills the mug.
Action: Microwave the mug on high for about 1 minute, or until the cake has risen and is cooked through. *

Step 9:

Image Description: The cake has been microwaved and now sits in the mug, warm and fluffy. The surface is soft, and the cake has risen slightly above the rim.
Action: Let the cake cool for a few minutes before eating. *
