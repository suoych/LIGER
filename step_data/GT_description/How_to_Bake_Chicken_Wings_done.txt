Step 1: 
Image Description: A sleek silver oven door, with the display showing the temperature set to 400°F. The oven racks inside are visible, clean and empty, with a soft warm light reflecting from the preheating process.
Action: Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) *
Step 2: 
Image Description: A large, rectangular baking sheet is lined with shiny aluminum foil, fitted smoothly to the edges. A metal wire rack sits on top of the foil, elevated slightly above the surface to allow air circulation. The rack is clean and ready to hold the chicken wings.
Action: Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and place a wire rack on top of it *
Step 3: 
Image Description: A large bowl holds raw chicken wings, their skin pale and slightly glossy from the oil. The wings are coated with a sprinkle of coarse salt, freshly ground black pepper, and a dusting of paprika. The seasonings are beginning to blend into the oil, creating a vibrant reddish-brown tint on the skin.
Action: In a mixing bowl, combine 2 pounds of chicken wings, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon of paprika *
Step 4: 
Image Description: The seasoned chicken wings are neatly arranged in a single layer on the wire rack. Each wing sits slightly elevated above the foil-lined baking sheet, with the spices and oil giving the skin a glossy, seasoned appearance. There is space between each wing to allow for even cooking.
Action: Arrange the chicken wings in a single layer on the wire rack *
Step 5: 
Image Description: The baking sheet with the chicken wings is placed on the middle rack of the preheated oven. The wings are starting to cook, with the skin gradually turning golden and slightly crisp around the edges. Steam rises lightly from the wings as they bake.
Action: Bake the wings in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes *
Step 6: 
Image Description: The wings are being flipped over with tongs, revealing the underside, which is already golden and crisp. The skin is evenly browned, with small bubbles of fat visible as it crisps up. The wings continue to bake until they develop a rich, golden-brown color, with a crispy texture across the surface.
Action: Flip the wings and bake for another 20-25 minutes until they are crispy and fully cooked *
Step 7: 
Image Description: The golden chicken wings are resting on the wire rack. The skin is deeply browned, with a slight sheen from the oil and seasonings. A gentle steam rises from the wings as they cool slightly, ensuring the juices settle inside for a tender bite.
Action: Remove the wings from the oven and let them rest for a few minutes before serving *
