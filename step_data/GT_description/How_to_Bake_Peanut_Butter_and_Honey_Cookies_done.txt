Step 1:
Image Description: A sleek silver oven door, with the display showing the temperature set to 350°F. The oven racks inside are visible, clean and empty, with a soft warm light reflecting from the preheating process.
Action: Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit *

Step 2:
Image Description: A large mixing bowl holds smooth, creamy peanut butter, with a rich, light brown color and a glossy surface. The thick peanut butter clings to the sides of the bowl as it’s spooned in, showing its dense texture.
Action: In a large bowl, combine 1 cup of peanut butter *

Step 3:
Image Description: A golden stream of honey is poured into the bowl, resting on top of the thick peanut butter. The honey is glossy and viscous, creating a shimmering layer that contrasts with the more matte peanut butter.
Action: Add 1/2 cup of honey to the peanut butter *

Step 4:
Image Description: A single egg is cracked into the bowl, with the bright yellow yolk and clear egg white sitting in the center of the peanut butter and honey mixture. The egg adds a smooth, liquid texture to the thick peanut butter and honey.
Action: Crack 1 egg into the mixture *

Step 5:
Image Description: A spoon or whisk blends the egg, peanut butter, and honey together. The mixture becomes smooth and slightly glossy, turning into a thick, creamy dough with a uniform light brown color. There are no visible streaks of egg or honey remaining.
Action: Mix the ingredients until well combined *

Step 6:
Image Description: Small, rounded portions of the dough are being spooned onto a baking sheet, spaced evenly. Each portion is soft and slightly sticky, with a smooth, shiny surface from the honey and peanut butter.
Action: Scoop tablespoon-sized portions of dough and place them on a baking sheet *

Step 7:
Image Description: A fork is pressed gently into the top of each dough ball, flattening it slightly and creating a distinct crisscross pattern. The dough holds the pattern well, with the ridges from the fork leaving deep, defined marks.
Action: Press each dough portion with a fork to create a crisscross pattern *

Step 8:
Image Description: The cookies are inside the oven, gently rising as they bake. The edges are turning golden, and the crisscross pattern on the top of each cookie becomes more pronounced. The cookies give off a warm, nutty aroma.
Action: Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes *

Step 9:
Image Description: The freshly baked cookies rest on the baking sheet, their edges firming up as they cool. The tops are golden brown, and the crisscross pattern is crisp and defined. A faint steam rises from the warm cookies.
Action: Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes *

Step 10:
Image Description: The cookies are being lifted off the baking sheet and placed onto a wire cooling rack. The cookies hold their shape well, with a slightly crisp exterior and a soft, chewy interior visible through small cracks on the surface as they cool completely.
Action: Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool completely *
