Step 1:
Image Description: A modern oven door with the digital display showing 425°F. The inside of the oven is clean and empty, with the warm glow of the heating elements visible, indicating the oven is preheating.
Action: Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C) *

Step 2:
Image Description: A large saucepan filled with cubed chicken breast, diced carrots, diced potatoes, peas, and corn. The mixture is colorful, with the pink chicken and vibrant vegetables ready to cook together.
Action: In a large saucepan, combine 1 cubed chicken breast, 1 cup of diced carrots, 1 cup of diced potatoes, 1/2 cup of peas, and 1/2 cup of corn *

Step 3:
Image Description: The chicken and vegetable mixture in the saucepan is covered with water and bubbling as it boils. Steam rises as the chicken turns from pink to white, and the vegetables soften as they cook.
Action: Pour in enough water to cover the mixture, and bring it to a boil. Cook until the chicken is no longer pink and the vegetables are tender *

Step 4:
Image Description: The boiled chicken and vegetables are being drained in a colander, with excess water pouring out. The cooked chicken is white and the vegetables are tender, ready to be set aside.
Action: Drain the chicken and vegetable mixture, and set it aside *

Step 5:
Image Description: The same saucepan now has a small amount of melted butter at the bottom. The butter is a golden yellow, starting to bubble gently as it melts over medium heat.
Action: In the same saucepan, melt 1/3 cup of butter over medium heat *

Step 6:
Image Description: Chopped onions, flour, salt, and black pepper are stirred into the melted butter. The ingredients combine to form a thick, fragrant paste, with the onions beginning to soften.
Action: Stir in 1/3 cup of chopped onion, 1/3 cup of flour, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper *

Step 7:
Image Description: Chicken broth and milk are slowly whisked into the butter and flour mixture, creating a smooth, creamy sauce. The liquid turns pale as it thickens, with no lumps in sight.
Action: Slowly whisk in 1 3/4 cups of chicken broth and 2/3 cup of milk until smooth *

Step 8:
Image Description: The sauce in the saucepan is bubbling gently as it thickens. The mixture has become creamy and smooth, with the spoon leaving trails as it stirs through the thick sauce.
Action: Cook and stir the mixture until it thickens and starts to bubble *

Step 9:
Image Description: The drained chicken and vegetables are stirred back into the thickened sauce. The chicken and vegetables are now coated in the creamy mixture, creating a hearty, flavorful filling.
Action: Stir the drained chicken and vegetables back into the sauce *

Step 10:
Image Description: The chicken and vegetable mixture is being spooned into a pie dish lined with a golden pie crust. The crust is smooth and pressed evenly into the dish, ready to hold the filling.
Action: Place the chicken mixture in a pie dish lined with one pie crust *

Step 11:
Image Description: A second pie crust is being carefully placed over the filled pie dish. The edges are being sealed by pressing the two crusts together, and small slits are cut into the top crust to allow steam to escape.
Action: Cover with the second pie crust, seal the edges, and cut small slits in the top to allow steam to escape *

Step 12:
Image Description: The pie dish is placed inside the preheated oven. The pie crust is beginning to turn golden, with the edges crisping up and the filling bubbling slightly beneath the top layer.
Action: Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown *

Step 13:
Image Description: The baked chicken pot pie sits on the counter, its crust golden brown and perfectly flaky. Steam rises from the slits in the crust, and the pie cools slightly before serving.
Action: Allow to cool for 10 minutes before serving *
