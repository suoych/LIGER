Step 1:
Image Description: A large mixing bowl containing fine white flour, chunks of cold butter, and a small stream of cold water being added. The butter is pale yellow and firm, while the flour is dry and powdery. A spatula or hand is seen working the ingredients together.
Action: Prepare the dough by mixing flour, butter, and cold water to form a pastry dough. *

Step 2:
Image Description: A smooth, round ball of pastry dough is being rolled out on a floured surface. The rolling pin spreads the dough into an even, thin sheet. The dough is then carefully placed into a pie dish, with the edges being trimmed neatly to fit the dish perfectly.
Action: Roll out the pastry dough and fit it into a pie dish, trimming the excess. *

Step 3:
Image Description: A close-up of an oven’s display shows the temperature being set to 375°F (190°C). The oven racks are visible inside, clean and ready for baking, with a faint glow.
Action: Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). *

Step 4:
Image Description: A bowl containing cooked salmon fillets. A fork or fingers are flaking the salmon into small, tender pieces. The salmon is light pink with a moist texture, gently falling apart into bite-sized flakes.
Action: Prepare the filling by flaking the cooked salmon into a bowl. *

Step 5:
Image Description: Chopped onions and sprigs of fresh dill are added to the flaked salmon. The onions are finely diced, and the dill is a vibrant green, adding color and texture. Salt and pepper are sprinkled over the mixture.
Action: Add chopped onion, dill, salt, and pepper to the salmon. *

Step 6:
Image Description: A spoon is stirring thick sour cream and a splash of lemon juice into the salmon mixture. The creamy white sour cream blends smoothly, creating a rich, moist filling that coats the flaked salmon and herbs evenly.
Action: Stir in sour cream and lemon juice until combined. *

Step 7:
Image Description: The creamy salmon mixture is poured into the pastry-lined pie dish. The filling spreads out evenly, filling the dish to just below the rim. The mixture looks rich and textured, with pieces of salmon and flecks of green dill visible.
Action: Pour the salmon mixture into the prepared pastry shell. *

Step 8:
Image Description: A second sheet of rolled-out pastry dough is carefully draped over the filled pie dish. The edges of the top and bottom dough are being pinched together, sealing the filling inside. The dough is smooth, with no air bubbles, creating a uniform covering over the filling.
Action: Roll out a second piece of dough and place it over the filling, sealing the edges. *

Step 9:
Image Description: A sharp knife is being used to make small slits on the top of the pie. The cuts are neat and evenly spaced, allowing steam to escape during baking. The pie is now fully prepared, with the slits adding a decorative touch.
Action: Make small slits on top of the pie to allow steam to escape. *

Step 10:
Image Description: A pastry brush is used to apply a shiny layer of beaten egg over the top of the pie. The egg wash gives the dough a glossy finish, ensuring the crust will bake to a golden brown color. The surface of the pie looks smooth.
Action: Brush the top of the pie with beaten egg for a golden crust. *

Step 11:
Image Description: The pie is now in the oven, its surface gradually turning golden brown. The edges are crisping up, and the slits on top are slightly expanding as steam escapes. The rich aroma of baked pastry fills the air as the pie bakes evenly.
Action: Bake in the preheated oven for 40-45 minutes or until the crust is golden brown. *

Step 12:
Image Description: The baked pie has been removed from the oven and is cooling on a countertop. The crust is a perfect golden brown, with slight flakiness around the edges. The pie is firm and holds its shape as it cools.
Action: Allow the pie to cool slightly before serving. *
