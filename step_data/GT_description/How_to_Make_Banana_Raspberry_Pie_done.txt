Step 1:

Image Description: A digital oven display shows the temperature being set to 375째F (190째C), with the oven light on, signaling the preheating process.
Action: Preheat your oven to 375째F (190째C). *

Step 2:

Image Description: A rolled-out pie crust is gently placed into a pie dish, pressed down to fit the shape of the dish, with the excess dough being trimmed neatly around the edges using a small knife.
Action: Roll out the pie crust and place it into a pie dish, trimming excess dough around the edges. *

Step 3:

Image Description: The pie crust is lined with even layers of thinly sliced, ripe bananas. The soft, yellow banana slices cover the entire bottom of the crust.
Action: Slice 3 to 4 ripe bananas and layer them evenly on the bottom of the crust. *

Step 4:

Image Description: In a separate bowl, bright red raspberries are mixed with white sugar and cornstarch. The sugar begins to dissolve, and the cornstarch coats the berries, thickening the mixture slightly.
Action: In a separate bowl, mix 2 cups of raspberries with 1/2 cup of sugar and 1 tablespoon of cornstarch. *

Step 5:

Image Description: The raspberry mixture is poured evenly over the banana slices in the pie crust. The vibrant red raspberries contrast with the pale yellow banana base, filling the dish.
Action: Pour the raspberry mixture over the banana slices in the pie dish. *

Step 6:

Image Description: A second rolled-out pie crust is carefully placed on top of the filled pie. The edges of the top crust are crimped firmly against the bottom crust to seal the pie, forming a decorative border.
Action: Place another rolled-out pie crust on top, crimping the edges to seal. *

Step 7:

Image Description: A knife is used to cut small, neat slits in the top crust, allowing steam to escape while baking. The slits form a pattern across the surface of the pie.
Action: Use a knife to make small slits in the top crust for steam to escape. *

Step 8:

Image Description: The pie is baking in the preheated oven, its crust turning a golden brown. The filling bubbles up through the steam slits.
Action: Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly. *

Step 9:

Image Description: The freshly baked pie sits on a wire rack, cooling. The crust is perfectly golden, and the pie rests as steam rises faintly from the surface.
Action: Let the pie cool on a wire rack before serving. *
