Step 1:
Image Description: A sleek oven door with the display showing a temperature of 375°F. The oven’s interior is visible with empty racks, and a soft glow emanates from inside as the oven heats up. The metallic surfaces of the oven reflect the warm light.
Action: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) *

Step 2:
Image Description: A large mixing bowl is filled with dry ingredients: fine white all-purpose flour, granulated sugar, off-white baking powder and baking soda, and a pinch of fine salt. The ingredients are sitting in separate piles, ready to be mixed together, with a slight powdery texture from the flour and sugar.
Action: In a bowl, combine 1 3/4 cups of all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup of sugar, 1 tsp of baking powder, 1/2 tsp of baking soda, and 1/2 tsp of salt *

Step 3:
Image Description: A second bowl holds the wet ingredients: smooth mashed sweet potato with a vibrant orange hue, glossy vegetable oil, two cracked eggs with bright yellow yolks, and a small stream of vanilla extract being poured in. The mixture is being whisked together, combining into a smooth, creamy consistency.
Action: In another bowl, whisk together 1 cup of mashed sweet potato, 1/2 cup of vegetable oil, 2 eggs, and 1 tsp of vanilla extract *

Step 4:
Image Description: The bowl of wet ingredients is being poured into the dry ingredients. The smooth, creamy orange mixture flows into the flour mixture, which still has a dry, powdery texture. The two elements are about to be combined, creating a contrast of textures.
Action: Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients *

Step 5:
Image Description: The wet and dry ingredients are now being stirred together in a large mixing bowl. The batter is thick and slightly lumpy, with streaks of orange from the sweet potato and white from the flour as they combine. The mixture is coming together but still slightly uneven, just barely blended.
Action: Stir until just combined *

Step 6:
Image Description: Fresh or dried cranberries is being gently folded into the muffin batter. The red cranberries stand out brightly against the pale orange batter, with the berries evenly distributed throughout. The batter has a thick, dense texture as it is carefully mixed.
Action: Gently fold in 1 cup of fresh or dried cranberries *

Step 7:
Image Description: A standard muffin tin is lined with colorful paper liners, each slot ready to be filled with batter. The muffin tin has a clean, metallic appearance, and the paper liners are neatly arranged, waiting for the next step.
Action: Line a muffin tin with paper liners *

Step 8:
Image Description: The thick, orange muffin batter is being spooned into the paper liners, filling each one about 3/4 full. The cranberries are visible within the batter, and the liners hold the batter in neat, rounded mounds.
Action: Fill the liners 3/4 full with batter *

Step 9:
Image Description: The muffin tin filled with batter is now in the preheated oven. The muffins are starting to rise, their tops rounding and setting as the batter bakes. The tops are slightly golden, and a toothpick inserted into one of the muffins is about to come out clean.
Action: Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean *

Step 10:
Image Description: The muffin tin is being removed from the oven, with the muffins fully baked and golden brown on top. The muffins are placed on a wire rack, cooling down. Steam is gently rising from the tops of the muffins, indicating that they are still warm but firming up as they cool.
Action: Remove from oven and let cool on a wire rack *

Step 11:
Image Description: The muffins are now fully cooled and resting on a wire rack, their golden tops slightly domed. The cranberries are visible, dotting the tops of the muffins. A serving plate with a few muffins arranged neatly invites you to enjoy them, with a soft, fluffy texture revealed from one muffin that has been broken open.
Action: Serve and enjoy your sweet potato and cranberry muffins *
