Step 8:
Image Description: The chocolate-covered toffee pieces are placed on a parchment-lined baking sheet. The chocolate is glossy and smooth, setting as the pieces rest on the sheet.
Action: Place the chocolate-covered toffee pieces on a parchment-lined baking sheet to set *

Step 9:
Image Description: The chocolate-covered toffee has fully set, and the pieces are being chopped into small bits. The combination of crunchy toffee and firm chocolate creates bite-sized chunks, perfect for mixing into ice cream.
Action: Once the chocolate is fully set, chop the toffee into small bits *

Step 10:
Image Description: The chopped toffee bits are being stirred into softened vanilla ice cream. The bits mix evenly into the creamy ice cream, adding texture and flavor throughout the mixture.
