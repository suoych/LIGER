Step 1:
Image Description: A sharp knife is slicing a large onion into clean, even rings. The onion rings are separated and laid out in a neat stack, showcasing their white, translucent layers.
Action: Slice the onions into rings *

Step 2:
Image Description: A bowl is filled with plain white flour. The flour is soft and powdery, ready to coat the sliced onion rings, which sit beside the bowl.
Action: Prepare a bowl with flour *

Step 3:
Image Description: A second bowl holds a single egg being cracked open, and the yolk and egg white are being whisked together to form a smooth, yellow mixture. The first bowl of flour and the sliced onion rings are visible nearby.
Action: In another bowl, beat an egg *

Step 4:
Image Description: A third bowl is prepared with a pile of fine, golden breadcrumbs. The three bowls—flour, beaten egg, and breadcrumbs—are now lined up in sequence, with the sliced onion rings next to them.
Action: Prepare a third bowl with breadcrumbs *

Step 5:
Image Description: Each onion ring is being dipped into the bowl of flour, lightly coating the surface. The flour clings to the wet surface of the onion, creating an even white coating.
Action: Dip each onion ring first into the flour *

Step 6:
Image Description: The flour-coated onion rings are now being dipped into the bowl of beaten egg. The smooth egg mixture clings to the surface of the rings, giving them a wet, glossy appearance.
Action: Dip the floured onion rings into the beaten egg *

Step 7:
Image Description: The onion rings, now coated in both flour and egg, are being dipped into the breadcrumbs. The golden crumbs stick evenly to the surface, covering the rings completely in a crunchy layer.
Action: Dip the onion rings into the breadcrumbs, coating them evenly *

Step 8:
Image Description: A large pot is being filled with oil, which is starting to heat up. The oil shimmers as it reaches the right temperature for frying, while the prepared, breaded onion rings sit nearby.
Action: Heat oil in a deep fryer or large pot *

Step 9:
Image Description: The onion rings are being carefully lowered into the hot oil. They sizzle as they begin to fry, turning golden brown and crisp around the edges as they float in the bubbling oil.
Action: Fry the onion rings until golden brown *

Step 10:
Image Description: The fried onion rings, golden and crispy, are being lifted out of the oil with a slotted spoon and placed on paper towels. The paper towels absorb the excess oil, leaving the onion rings perfectly crispy.
Action: Remove the onion rings from the oil and let them drain on paper towels *

Step 11:
Image Description: The drained onion rings are piled on a plate, hot and crispy, ready to serve. A small bowl of dipping sauce is placed next to them, making the dish look inviting.
Action: Serve the onion rings hot with your favorite dipping sauce *
