Step 1:
Image Description: A sleek silver oven door, with the display showing the temperature set to 400°F. The oven racks inside are visible, clean and empty, with a soft warm light reflecting from the preheating process.
Action: Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) *

Step 2:
Image Description: A large mixing bowl holds a pile of pale yellow cornmeal, light white flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, and fine salt. The dry ingredients are layered, with the cornmeal’s coarse texture contrasting against the soft, powdery flour and sugar.
Action: In a large mixing bowl, combine 1 cup of cornmeal, 1 cup of flour, 1/4 cup of sugar, 1 tablespoon of baking powder, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt *

Step 3:
Image Description: A separate bowl contains smooth, white milk, golden melted butter, and a large cracked egg. A whisk is blending the ingredients together, creating a creamy, pale yellow mixture that is smooth and slightly frothy on top.
Action: In another bowl, whisk together 1 cup of milk, 1/4 cup of melted butter, and 1 large egg *

Step 4:
Image Description: The wet milk, butter, and egg mixture is being poured into the bowl of dry ingredients. The smooth liquid pools at the center of the dry ingredients, creating a contrast between the creamy wet mixture and the coarse, powdery dry mixture.
Action: Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture *

Step 5:
Image Description: A wooden spoon is stirring the wet and dry ingredients together. The mixture is thick and slightly lumpy, with some small clumps of cornmeal and flour still visible. The batter is not fully smooth but has a cohesive, thick texture.
Action: Stir until just combined and the batter is lumpy *

Step 6:
Image Description: A standard muffin tin is being greased with butter or oil, giving it a shiny, slightly slick appearance. Alternatively, paper liners are neatly placed into each muffin cup, creating a clean and non-stick surface for the batter.
Action: Grease a muffin tin or line it with paper liners *

Step 7:
Image Description: The lumpy cornmeal batter is being spooned into each muffin cup, filling them about two-thirds of the way up. The batter sits slightly uneven in each cup, with a thick, textured appearance and a pale yellow color.
Action: Fill each muffin cup about two-thirds full with batter *

Step 8:
Image Description: The muffin tin sits in the center of the oven, and the tops of the muffins are turning a warm, golden brown. The batter has risen slightly, and a toothpick inserted into one of the muffins comes out clean, signaling they are fully baked. The tops have a slightly cracked texture from the baking process.
Action: Bake in preheated oven for about 15 to 20 minutes, until golden brown and a toothpick inserted comes out clean *

Step 9:
Image Description: The golden brown muffins are resting in the muffin tin for a few minutes. Steam rises gently from the tops of the muffins as they cool. After cooling briefly, the muffins are lifted out of the tin and placed on a wire rack, where they will continue to cool completely, showing off their light, fluffy texture.
Action: Remove from oven and let cool for a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely *
