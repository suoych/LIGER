Step 1:
Image Description: A spoonful of chicken noodle soup is lifted from the pot for tasting. The soup is golden with visible noodles, chunks of tender chicken, and bits of vegetables like carrots and celery, all floating in a rich broth.
Action: Taste the chicken noodle soup to assess its saltiness levels *

Step 2:
Image Description: A peeled, halved potato is gently lowered into the soup. The potato is smooth and pale, sitting among the soupâ€™s chicken, noodles, and vegetables, ready to absorb excess salt.
Action: Add a peeled and halved potato to the soup, allowing it to absorb some of the saltiness *

Step 3:
Image Description: The pot of chicken noodle soup is simmering with bubbles rising to the surface, and the halved potato is partially submerged. The soup continues to swirl gently, with steam rising from the pot as it simmers.
Action: Let the soup simmer for about 15-20 minutes to give the potato time to absorb the salt *

Step 4:
Image Description: The halved potato is being carefully removed from the pot with a slotted spoon, leaving behind the soup, which is still gently simmering. The potato looks slightly soft from soaking in the broth.
Action: Remove the potato from the soup and taste it again to check if the saltiness has reduced *

Step 5:
Image Description: Water or unsalted broth is being poured into the soup from a small measuring cup, lightly diluting the broth. The soup swirls as the new liquid blends in, slightly altering the depth of the broth.
Action: If still too salty, add a little bit of water or unsalted broth to dilute the soup *

Step 6:
Image Description: Another spoonful of the soup is being lifted from the pot for tasting. The broth looks lighter after dilution, and the ingredients (chicken, noodles, and vegetables) remain visible in the spoonful.
Action: Taste the soup again to ensure the saltiness is to your preference *

Step 7:
Image Description: Freshly cracked pepper, finely minced garlic, and chopped parsley are being sprinkled over the pot of soup, adding an extra layer of flavor. The seasonings settle into the broth, adding visual texture and a burst of aroma.
Action: Add additional seasonings or herbs such as pepper, garlic, or parsley to enhance flavor if necessary *
