Step 1:
Image Description: A large mixing bowl holds a soft, white mound of all-purpose flour. The flour is finely ground, forming a light, powdery heap in the center of the bowl, ready to be mixed with other ingredients.
Action: In a mixing bowl, combine 1 cup of flour *

Step 2:
Image Description: Two cracked eggs are being added to the flour in the mixing bowl. The golden yellow yolks sit atop the flour, while the clear, glossy egg whites start to seep into the powder. The eggs contrast against the soft, pale flour.
Action: Add 2 eggs to the flour *

Step 3:
Image Description: A steady stream of milk is being poured into the mixing bowl, blending with the eggs and flour. A spoon or whisk is stirring the mixture, gradually creating a smooth, pale yellow batter. The liquid consistency begins to thicken slightly as the ingredients combine.
Action: Gradually add 1 cup of milk while stirring *

Step 4:
Image Description: A pinch of fine, white salt and two tablespoons of melted butter are added to the smooth batter. The butter forms small golden pools on the surface of the mixture, creating a glossy appearance as it blends with the batter. The salt dissolves quickly, invisible in the creamy mixture.
Action: Add a pinch of salt and 2 tablespoons of melted butter to the mixture *

Step 5:
Image Description: A lightly oiled frying pan is heating over medium-high heat. The oil is spread thinly across the surface, creating a shiny, reflective layer. The pan is ready to cook, with a faint shimmer from the heat.
Action: Heat a lightly oiled frying pan over medium-high heat *

Step 6:
Image Description: A ladle or measuring cup is pouring a smooth, pale yellow batter onto the hot frying pan. The batter forms a round, even puddle in the center of the pan, with a thin, consistent texture.
Action: Pour or scoop the batter onto the frying pan, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe *

Step 7:
Image Description: The frying pan is tilted in a circular motion, causing the thin batter to spread out evenly across the surface. The batter flows smoothly, forming a large, flat, uniform layer that covers the pan completely.
Action: Tilt the pan in a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly *

Step 8:
Image Description: The crepe is cooking in the pan, with the bottom turning a light, golden brown. Small air bubbles form on the surface as the batter cooks. The edges of the crepe are slightly lifting.
Action: Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown *

Step 9:
Image Description: A spatula is being gently slipped under the crepe, lifting it slightly from the pan. The crepe is then flipped, revealing a light golden-brown underside. The second side is cooking, with the crepe taking on a smooth, even color.
Action: Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side *

Step 10:
Image Description: The finished crepes are stacked on a plate, their delicate, golden layers visible. They are served hot, ready to be filled with a variety of favorite toppings such as fresh fruit, whipped cream, or chocolate spread.
Action: Serve hot with your favorite fillings *
