Action: Bake in the preheated oven for 40 to 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean *

Step 10:
Image Description: The baked cake is cooling in the pan. The edges are set, and the top is smooth and golden. After cooling, the cake is being carefully turned out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
Action: Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely *
