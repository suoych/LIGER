Image Description: A large yellow spaghetti squash is being cut in half lengthwise on a cutting board. The firm outer skin is smooth, while the inside reveals a pale yellow flesh. The two halves are cleanly separated, showing the seeds in the center.
Action: Cut the spaghetti squash in half lengthwise *

Step 3:

Image Description: A spoon is being used to scoop out the seeds from the center of each squash half. The seeds and stringy pulp are removed, leaving the smooth, pale flesh exposed and ready for seasoning.
Action: Scoop out the seeds from the squash halves *

Step 4:

Image Description: A golden stream of olive oil is drizzled over the cut sides of the squash halves. The oil adds a glossy sheen to the flesh, coating it evenly and preparing the squash for roasting.
Action: Drizzle olive oil over the cut sides of the squash halves *

Step 5:

Image Description: A light sprinkling of coarse salt and freshly cracked black pepper is added to the oiled squash halves. The seasonings sit on the glossy surface, creating small specks of flavor across the pale yellow flesh.
Action: Season with salt and pepper *

Step 6:

Image Description: The seasoned squash halves are placed cut-side down on a metal baking sheet. The exposed skin faces upward, with the edges of the squash halves slightly touching the sheet. The oil creates a faint sheen on the skin as the squash is ready for roasting.
Action: Place the squash halves cut-side down on a baking sheet *

Step 7:

Image Description: The baking sheet with the squash halves is placed on the middle rack of the oven. The squash is roasting, with the skin turning slightly darker and wrinkled. The flesh inside is becoming soft and tender, and a warm, nutty aroma fills the air.
Action: Roast in the oven for about 40-50 minutes, or until tender *

Step 8:

Image Description: The roasted squash halves are removed from the oven, their skins wrinkled and browned slightly from the heat. The squash is cooling slightly, with faint steam rising from the cut sides. The flesh is tender and ready to be scraped.
Action: Remove from oven and let cool slightly *

Step 9:

Image Description: A fork is being dragged across the inside of the squash, pulling up long, pale yellow strands of spaghetti-like squash flesh. The flesh separates easily into delicate, thin strands, resembling pasta in texture and appearance.
Action: Use a fork to scrape the inside of the squash, creating spaghetti-like strands *

Step 10:

Image Description: The spaghetti-like squash strands are served on a plate, ready to be topped with sauce or other ingredients. The strands are light and tender, with a slight gloss from the olive oil. The dish is simple yet inviting, ready for the addition of toppings or sauce.
