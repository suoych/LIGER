Step 1:
Image Description: Four large potatoes are being peeled with a vegetable peeler. The pale, smooth surface of the peeled potatoes contrasts with the rough, brown skins being removed. After peeling, the potatoes are rinsed under cold, clear water, ready for grating.
Action: Peel 4 large potatoes and rinse them under cold water *

Step 2:
Image Description: The peeled potatoes are being grated using a box grater. Long, thin strands of potato fall onto a plate or bowl, creating a mound of fresh, white grated potato. The texture is slightly moist and soft, with some small pieces of potato visible.
Action: Grate the potatoes using a box grater or food processor *

Step 3:
Image Description: The grated potatoes are submerged in a large bowl of cold water. The water becomes slightly cloudy as the starch is released from the potatoes, helping to prevent the potatoes from browning and creating a crispier texture when cooked.
Action: Place the grated potatoes in a large bowl of cold water to remove excess starch *

Step 4:
Image Description: The potatoes are drained from the water, and a clean kitchen towel or cheesecloth is used to squeeze out the excess moisture. The grated potatoes are tightly wrapped, with water being pressed out, leaving the potato strands dry and ready for cooking.
Action: Drain the potatoes and squeeze out as much moisture as possible using a clean kitchen towel or cheesecloth *

Step 5:
Image Description: The dry, grated potatoes are placed in a large mixing bowl, and salt and black pepper are sprinkled on top. The potatoes are lightly tossed to ensure the seasoning is evenly distributed throughout the mixture.
Action: In a large mixing bowl, mix the grated potatoes with 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper *

Step 6:
Image Description: A large skillet is heating on the stovetop with oil. The oil spreads out evenly across the surface of the pan, shimmering slightly as it heats up.
Action: Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat *

Step 7:
Image Description: The seasoned grated potatoes are spread evenly in the hot skillet. They are pressed down slightly with a spatula to create an even layer, forming a flat, cohesive shape that will become crispy as it cooks.
Action: Spread the grated potatoes evenly in the skillet, pressing them down slightly *

Step 8:
Image Description: The potatoes are cooking in the skillet, with the bottom layer turning golden brown and crispy. The edges of the potatoes are slightly lifting, revealing a crunchy, golden texture forming underneath. No stirring occurs as the potatoes cook evenly.
Action: Cook the potatoes without stirring until the bottom is golden brown and crispy, about 5-7 minutes *

Step 9:
Image Description: A spatula is used to carefully flip the hash browns in the skillet. The previously cooked side is now a perfect golden brown, with crispy edges. The second side is cooking.
Action: Flip the hash browns and cook the other side until golden brown and crispy, about 5-7 minutes *

Step 10:
Image Description: The fully cooked hash browns are removed from the skillet with a spatula, revealing a crispy, golden brown exterior with a soft, fluffy interior. The hash browns are placed on a serving plate.
Action: Remove the hash browns from the skillet and serve hot *
