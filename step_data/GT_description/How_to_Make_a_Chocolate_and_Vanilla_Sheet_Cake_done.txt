Step 1:
Image Description: An oven is preheating to 350°F (175°C) with a greased sheet cake pan ready on the counter. The pan has a light, even coating of grease, ensuring the cake won’t stick during baking.
Action: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a sheet cake pan. *

Step 2:

Step 3:
Image Description: Eggs, milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract are added to the dry ingredients in the bowl. The liquid ingredients sit atop the dry mixture, ready to be combined into a batter.
Action: Add 2 eggs, 1 cup of milk, ½ cup of vegetable oil, and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. *

Step 4:
Image Description: The ingredients are mixed together, forming a smooth, thick chocolate batter. The mixture is fully blended, with no lumps remaining.
Action: Mix the ingredients until well combined. *

Step 5:
Image Description: Half of the chocolate batter is poured into the greased sheet cake pan. The batter spreads evenly across the bottom, creating a smooth layer.
Action: Pour half of the batter into the prepared sheet cake pan. *

Step 6:
Image Description: Another mixing bowl is filled with dry ingredients for the vanilla layer: flour, sugar, baking powder, and baking soda.
Action: In another bowl, combine 2 cups of flour, 1 ½ cups of sugar, 2 teaspoons of baking powder, and 1 ½ teaspoons of baking soda. *

Step 7:
Image Description: Eggs, milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract are added to the dry ingredients in the second bowl. The liquid ingredients sit on top, waiting to be mixed.
Action: Add 2 eggs, 1 cup of milk, ½ cup of vegetable oil, and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. *

Step 8:
Image Description: The vanilla cake ingredients are mixed until smooth, forming a creamy, pale batter with a consistent texture.
Action: Mix the ingredients until well combined. *

Step 9:
Image Description: The vanilla batter is poured over the chocolate batter in the sheet cake pan. A spatula is gently swirling the two batters together, creating a marbled effect.
Action: Pour the vanilla batter over the chocolate batter in the sheet cake pan and use a spatula to swirl the two together gently. *

Step 10:
Image Description: The sheet cake pan filled with swirled chocolate and vanilla batter is placed in the oven. The cake begins to rise as it bakes, and the batter sets evenly.
Action: Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. *

Step 11:
Image Description: The baked cake is removed from the oven and placed on a cooling rack. The surface is golden and firm, indicating it’s fully baked, and the cake cools completely before frosting or serving.
