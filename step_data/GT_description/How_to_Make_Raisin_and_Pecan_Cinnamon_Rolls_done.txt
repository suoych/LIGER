Action: Roll up the dough tightly, starting from the long side, and cut into 12 slices *

Step 12:
Image Description: The slices are placed into a greased baking dish, arranged side by side. They are covered and allowed to rise again, nearly doubling in size before baking.
Action: Place the slices in a greased baking dish, cover, and let rise until doubled in size (about 30 minutes) *

Step 13:
Image Description: The rolls are baking in the preheated oven at 350째F (175째C), turning golden brown as they rise and bake. The filling is bubbling inside each roll.
