Step 1:

Image Description: A mixing bowl with sourdough starter, warm water, and flour being combined. The starter is bubbling slightly, and the flour is loosely piled in the bowl.
Action: Combine 1 cup of sourdough starter, 1 1/2 cups of warm water, and 4 cups of flour in a mixing bowl *

Step 2:

Image Description: A sticky dough is beginning to form as the ingredients are mixed together in the bowl. The mixture is wet and elastic, clinging to the sides of the bowl and the spoon.
Action: Mix the ingredients until a sticky dough forms *

Step 3:

Image Description: The sticky dough is resting in the bowl, covered with a cloth. The dough appears loose and wet, preparing to hydrate and soften as it rests.
Action: Let the dough rest for 30 minutes *

Step 4:

Image Description: The rested dough is in the bowl, and two teaspoons of salt are sprinkled on top, ready to be mixed in thoroughly. The dough has become softer and more pliable after resting.
Action: Add 2 teaspoons of salt and mix until fully incorporated *

Step 5:

Image Description: The dough is being kneaded on a lightly floured surface. It is smooth and elastic, with hands working the dough by stretching and folding it repeatedly to develop the gluten.
Action: Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 10 minutes *

Step 6:

Image Description: The kneaded dough is shaped into a smooth, round ball and placed in a lightly oiled bowl. The dough ball has a soft surface, with a slight sheen from the oil.
Action: Shape the dough into a ball and place it in a lightly oiled bowl *

Step 7:

Image Description: The dough is covered with a damp cloth in the oiled bowl, left to rise at room temperature. The cloth keeps the dough moist as it rises.
Action: Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and let it rise for 4-12 hours at room temperature *

Step 8:

Image Description: The oven is being preheated to 450째F (230째C), with a Dutch oven placed inside to heat up. The oven glows as it reaches the correct temperature.
Action: Preheat the oven to 450째F (230째C) with a Dutch oven inside *

Step 9:

Image Description: The risen dough is carefully transferred from the bowl onto a piece of parchment paper. The dough is soft and airy, showing signs of a successful rise.
Action: Carefully transfer the dough to a piece of parchment paper *

Step 10:

Image Description: The dough is scored with a sharp razor or knife, creating shallow cuts on the surface. The scores will allow the dough to expand while baking, giving it a decorative finish.
Action: Score the top of the dough with a razor or sharp knife *

Step 11:

Image Description: The scored dough on parchment paper is being placed inside the preheated Dutch oven. The Dutch oven is hot, and the parchment paper helps transfer the dough easily without losing its shape.
Action: Place the dough with the parchment paper into the preheated Dutch oven *

Step 12:

Image Description: The Dutch oven is covered and placed in the oven to bake. The bread is baking inside, beginning to rise and form a crust while covered to trap the steam.
Action: Cover and bake for 20 minutes *

Step 13:

Image Description: The lid has been removed from the Dutch oven, revealing the bread with a light golden crust. It continues to bake uncovered, developing a deep, golden-brown color and a crispy exterior.
Action: Remove the lid and bake for an additional 25-30 minutes until the crust is deep golden brown *

Step 14:

Image Description: The fully baked loaf of sourdough is removed from the Dutch oven and cooling on a wire rack. The crust is golden and crisp.
Action: Remove the bread from the Dutch oven and let it cool on a wire rack *
