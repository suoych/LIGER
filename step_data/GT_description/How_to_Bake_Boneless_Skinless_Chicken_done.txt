Step 1:
Image Description: A sleek silver oven door, with the display showing the temperature set to 375°F. The oven racks inside are visible, clean and empty, with a soft warm light reflecting from the preheating process.
Action: Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C) *

Step 2:
Image Description: A clean, white ceramic baking dish holds several raw, boneless, skinless chicken breasts. The chicken has a pale pink color with a smooth texture, neatly arranged in the dish with a slight sheen from natural moisture.
Action: Place boneless, skinless chicken breasts into a baking dish *

Step 3:
Image Description: A stream of golden olive oil is drizzled over the chicken breasts, creating a light, glossy coating on the surface. The oil glistens as it spreads over the smooth chicken, preparing it for seasoning.
Action: Drizzle the chicken with olive oil *

Step 4:
Image Description: Small grains of coarse salt and freshly cracked black pepper are sprinkled over the oiled chicken breasts. The seasoning creates a speckled pattern across the smooth surface of the chicken, contrasting with the pale pink flesh.
Action: Season the chicken with salt and pepper *

Step 5:
Image Description: A light dusting of ground paprika adds a warm reddish hue to the chicken, while garlic powder leaves a fine, pale layer over the surface. The herbs and spices are evenly distributed, giving the chicken a vibrant, seasoned appearance.
Action: Add any other preferred herbs or spices, such as garlic powder or paprika *

Step 6:
Image Description: A sheet of shiny aluminum foil is tightly covering the baking dish, sealing in the seasoned chicken breasts. The foil is smooth and reflective, with the edges crimped securely around the sides of the dish.
Action: Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil *

Step 7:
Image Description: The covered baking dish is placed on the center rack of the preheated oven. The foil glistens under the oven light, and a gentle warmth radiates from the oven as the chicken begins to cook.
Action: Place the baking dish in the preheated oven *

Step 8:
Image Description: The baking dish remains covered in foil as it sits in the hot oven. Steam can be seen rising faintly from the edges of the foil, indicating the chicken is cooking inside. The oven temperature is steady, and the timer counts down.
Action: Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (75°C) *

Step 9:
Image Description: The foil-covered baking dish is being lifted with a faint trace of steam rising from the edges. The foil has a slight sheen from the heat, and the chicken inside is fully cooked.
Action: Remove the baking dish from the oven *

Step 10:
Image Description: The golden-brown chicken breasts resting in the dish. The surface of the chicken is moist and slightly glistening from the olive oil, and the spices are baked into the skin. The chicken sits for a few minutes, allowing the juices to settle.
Action: Let the chicken rest for 5 minutes before serving *
