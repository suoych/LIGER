Step 1:
Image Description: A large mixing bowl containing fine white flour, granulated sugar, and a small pinch of salt. The ingredients sit in soft piles, contrasting in texture.
Action: Prepare the tart crust by combining 1 and 1/4 cups of flour, 1/4 cup of sugar, and a pinch of salt in a mixing bowl. *

Step 2:
Image Description: Cold, diced butter cubes are being added to the flour mixture in the bowl. A pastry cutter or fork is used to cut the butter into the flour, creating a crumbly mixture with small, coarse crumbs. The butter remains visible in small, firm chunks.
Action: Cut in 1/2 cup of cold, diced butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. *

Step 3:
Image Description: A small amount of cold water is being added to the crumbly dough mixture. A spoon or hand is gently mixing it together, causing the dough to come together into a cohesive ball. The mixture becomes slightly moist and holds its shape.
Action: Add 2 tablespoons of cold water and mix until the dough comes together. *

Step 4:
Image Description: The dough has been rolled into a smooth disk and is being tightly wrapped in clear plastic wrap. The dough is firm and compact, ready to be chilled. The plastic wrap clings to the dough to preserve moisture during chilling.
Action: Roll the dough into a disk, wrap it in plastic wrap, and chill for 30 minutes. *

Step 5:
Image Description: The chilled dough disk is being rolled out on a floured surface with a rolling pin, flattened into a thin, even circle large enough to fit into a tart pan. The dough is firm but pliable after chilling.
Action: Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C) and roll out chilled dough to fit a tart pan. *

Step 6:
Image Description: The rolled-out dough is now pressed evenly into a tart pan. The edges are neatly trimmed, and a fork is being used to prick the bottom of the dough, creating small holes to allow steam to escape during baking.
Action: Press the dough into the tart pan and prick the bottom with a fork. *

Step 7:
Image Description: The tart crust is in the oven, starting to turn a golden brown. The edges are firming up, and the surface looks dry and crisp. The crust is evenly baked and cooling on a wire rack after being removed from the oven.
Action: Bake the crust for 15 minutes or until golden brown, then let it cool completely. *

Step 8:
Image Description: Sugar is melting in a saucepan over medium heat, turning from white crystals to a smooth, golden brown liquid. The caramel is bubbling gently as it melts, becoming thick and glossy.
Action: For the caramel, melt 1 cup of sugar in a saucepan over medium heat until golden brown. *

Step 9:
Image Description: The caramelized sugar is off the heat, and softened butter is being stirred into the mixture. The butter melts quickly, followed by a steady stream of heavy cream and a sprinkle of sea salt. The caramel becomes rich and glossy, thickening as the ingredients combine.
Action: Remove from heat and stir in 6 tablespoons of butter, followed by 1/2 cup of heavy cream and 1 teaspoon of sea salt. *

Step 10:
Image Description: The warm, golden caramel is being poured into the cooled tart crust, filling it to the edges. The surface of the caramel is smooth and shiny.
Action: Pour the salted caramel into the cooled crust and chill until set. *

Step 11:
Image Description: A small saucepan with heavy cream is heating, with small bubbles forming around the edges, just reaching a simmer. Chopped pieces of dark chocolate are waiting to be combined with the cream for the ganache.
Action: Heat 1/2 cup of heavy cream to a simmer and pour over 4 ounces of chopped chocolate. *

Step 12:
Image Description: The chopped chocolate is melting as it sits in the hot cream. After 2 minutes, a spoon is stirring the mixture, creating a smooth, glossy chocolate ganache. The texture is rich and velvety as the chocolate fully incorporates with the cream.
Action: Let sit for 2 minutes, then stir until smooth to make chocolate ganache. *

Step 13:
Image Description: The glossy, smooth chocolate ganache is being poured over the set caramel layer in the tart. A spatula spreads the ganache evenly, creating a silky, shiny surface across the top of the tart.
Action: Pour the ganache over the set caramel in the tart and smooth out evenly. *

Step 14:
Image Description: The tart, now topped with set chocolate ganache, is being chilled in the refrigerator. The surface of the ganache is firm and smooth, with a slight shine.
Action: Chill the tart until the ganache is set before serving. *
