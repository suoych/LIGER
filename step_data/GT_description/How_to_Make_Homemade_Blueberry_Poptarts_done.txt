Step 1:
Image Description: A large mixing bowl contains all-purpose flour and salt. The dry ingredients are sifted, creating a smooth base for the pie dough.
Action: In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 cups of all-purpose flour and 1/2 teaspoon of salt *

Step 2:
Image Description: A pastry cutter is used to cut in unsalted butter. The mixture resembles coarse crumbs, with small, pea-sized pieces of butter evenly distributed throughout the flour.
Action: Cut in 1 cup of unsalted butter using a pastry cutter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs *

Step 3:
Image Description: Ice water is being added to the flour and butter mixture. The dough is slowly coming together, forming a shaggy but cohesive mass.
Action: Add 4-5 tablespoons of ice water, one tablespoon at a time, mixing until the dough begins to come together *

Step 4:
Image Description: The dough is divided into two equal portions and wrapped in plastic wrap. Each portion is tightly sealed and placed in the refrigerator to chill for, firming up before rolling.
Action: Divide the dough into two equal parts, wrap each in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes *

Step 5:
Image Description: One portion of dough is removed from the refrigerator and rolled out on a floured surface. The dough is rolled to an even thickness of about 1/8 inch.
Action: Remove one portion of the dough from the refrigerator and roll it out on a floured surface to about 1/8 inch thickness *

Step 6:
Image Description: The rolled dough is cut into equal-sized rectangles, each approximately 3x4 inches. The rectangles are neatly arranged.
Action: Cut the rolled dough into equal-sized rectangles (about 3x4 inches each) *

Step 7:
Image Description: Half of the dough rectangles are placed on a parchment-lined baking sheet. These will form the bottom layer of the homemade poptarts.
Action: Place half of the rectangles on a parchment-lined baking sheet *

Step 8:
Image Description: A tablespoon of blueberry jam is added to the center of each dough rectangle. The jam is spread evenly, leaving space around the edges to seal the poptarts.
Action: Fill each rectangle with a tablespoon of blueberry jam, leaving some space around the edges *

Step 9:
Image Description: In a small bowl, 1 egg is beaten with 1 tablespoon of water, creating an egg wash. This will help the dough seal and give the poptarts a golden, shiny finish.
Action: Beat 1 egg with 1 tablespoon of water to create an egg wash *

Step 10:
Image Description: The edges of each jam-filled rectangle are brushed with the egg wash. The egg wash creates a sticky surface, helping the top layer of dough adhere when placed on top.
Action: Brush the edges of each filled rectangle with the egg wash *

Step 11:
Image Description: The remaining dough rectangles are placed on top of the jam-filled ones. A fork is used to press down the edges, sealing each poptart securely and creating a decorative edge.
Action: Place the remaining dough rectangles on top of the filled ones, pressing the edges together with a fork to seal *

Step 12:
Image Description: The tops of the assembled poptarts are brushed with the remaining egg wash, giving them a glossy finish. This will help them achieve a golden-brown color during baking.
Action: Brush the tops with the remaining egg wash *

Step 13:
Image Description: The oven is preheating to 375째F (190째C). The poptarts are ready to be baked once the oven reaches the proper temperature.
Action: Preheat the oven to 375째F (190째C) *

Step 14:
Image Description: The assembled poptarts are placed in the preheated oven. They bake, turning golden brown as the dough crisps up and the jam bubbles slightly.
Action: Bake the poptarts in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown *

Step 15:
Image Description: The baked poptarts are cooling on a wire rack. They are golden brown with crisp edges, and an optional simple glaze of powdered sugar and milk is drizzled on top for added sweetness.
Action: Allow the poptarts to cool on a wire rack before serving and optionally drizzle with a simple glaze made from powdered sugar and milk *
