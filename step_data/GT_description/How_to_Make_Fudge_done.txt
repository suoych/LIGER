Image Description: The mixture is heating over medium heat, with the butter melting and the sugar dissolving. The liquid starts to bubble gently as it is stirred constantly, ensuring an even mix as it approaches a boil.
Action: Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture comes to a full boil *

Step 3:
Image Description: The mixture is now at a rolling boil, with large bubbles rapidly breaking the surface. The saucepan is being stirred continuously to prevent burning as the mixture thickens.
Action: Boil for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring constantly to prevent burning *

Step 4:
Image Description: The saucepan is removed from the heat, with the bubbling mixture calming down. It has thickened slightly.

Action: Pour the mixture into a greased 9x13 inch pan *

Step 7:
Image Description: The fudge is left to cool at room temperature in the pan. As it sets, the top becomes firm and smooth, losing its glossy appearance.
Action: Let the fudge cool at room temperature until set *

Step 8:
Image Description: The cooled fudge is cut into neat, even squares with a knife. Each square is firm but soft, with a rich, chocolatey interior. The fudge is served.
