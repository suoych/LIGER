Step 1:
Image Description: A silver oven door with a digital display shows the temperature set to 375°F. The oven interior is empty with metal racks, and a faint warm light can be seen, indicating the preheating process has begun.
Action: Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C) *

Step 2:
Image Description: A large mixing bowl holds shredded chicken, finely shredded cheese, and smooth, rich enchilada sauce. The cheese is a light yellow color, while the sauce appears thick and deep red, coating the chicken in a glossy layer as they await mixing.
Action: In a large mixing bowl, combine shredded chicken, 1 cup of shredded cheese, and 1 cup of enchilada sauce *

Step 3:
Image Description: A soft, round tortilla is laid flat on a surface, and a heaping spoonful of the mixed chicken, cheese, and enchilada sauce sits in the center. The mixture is chunky and moist, with the red sauce and cheese strands clearly visible.
Action: Place a tortilla on a flat surface and spoon 2-3 tablespoons of the chicken mixture onto the center of the tortilla *

Step 4:
Image Description: The tortilla, now tightly rolled with its filling hidden inside, is carefully placed seam-side down in a greased baking dish. The tortilla is smooth and pale in color, with a slight sheen from the greasing, ready to hold its shape in the dish.
Action: Roll the tortilla tightly and place it seam-side down in a greased baking dish *

Step 5:
Image Description: The baking dish now contains multiple rolled tortillas, each neatly aligned and placed seam-side down. They form a tightly packed row, ready for the next step.
Action: Repeat the process with the remaining tortillas and chicken mixture *

Step 6:
Image Description: The enchilada sauce is being poured over the rolled tortillas, evenly coating them in a glossy, rich red layer. The sauce drips over the sides of the tortillas, pooling slightly at the edges of the baking dish.
Action: Pour the remaining enchilada sauce evenly over the top of the rolled tortillas *

Step 7:
Image Description: A generous amount of shredded cheese is being sprinkled over the sauced tortillas, creating an even layer. The light yellow cheese contrasts with the dark red sauce, promising a melty, bubbly finish after baking.
Action: Sprinkle the remaining shredded cheese over the top *

Step 8:
Image Description: The baking dish is now fully covered with smooth aluminum foil, tightly wrapped around the edges to secure the heat inside. The shape of the dish is slightly visible through the foil.
Action: Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil *

Step 9:
Image Description: The foil-covered baking dish is placed inside the preheated oven. The oven light illuminates the covered dish as it begins the baking process.
Action: Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes *

Step 10:
Image Description: The foil has been removed, revealing the enchiladas with melted, bubbling cheese on top. The cheese is golden brown in some spots, while the sauce continues to simmer around the edges.
Action: Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly *

Step 11:
Image Description: The fully baked enchiladas rest in the dish, the cheese is fully melted and golden, with small crispy edges. The sauce bubbles slightly, and steam rises.
Action: Let the enchiladas cool for a few minutes before serving *
