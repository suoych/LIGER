Step 1:
Image Description: A sleek silver oven door, with the display showing the temperature set to 350°F. The oven racks inside are visible, clean and empty, with a soft warm light reflecting from the preheating process.
Action: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) *

Step 2:
Image Description: A rectangular baking pan is lined with crisp parchment paper, neatly fitted into the corners. The parchment has a smooth texture, with a slight fold along the edges to hold its shape. Alternatively, if greased, the pan has a light sheen from a thin layer of oil or butter.
Action: Line a baking pan with parchment paper or lightly grease it *

Step 3:
Image Description: A large mixing bowl holds a textured mixture of rolled oats, roughly chopped nuts, and dried fruit. The oats are pale and dry, while the nuts add a crunchy, uneven appearance, and the dried fruit brings small, colorful pops of texture and color.
Action: In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 cups of rolled oats, 1 cup of chopped nuts, and 1 cup of dried fruit *

Step 4:
Image Description: A saucepan on the stove contains a golden mixture of melted butter, amber honey, and light brown sugar. The ingredients are combining into a smooth, glossy liquid, with the sugar dissolving into the butter and honey, creating a thick, syrupy consistency.
Action: In a saucepan, melt ½ cup of butter, ½ cup of honey, and ¼ cup of brown sugar over medium heat *

Step 5:
Image Description: The golden, melted butter-honey mixture is being poured in a steady stream over the dry oat, nut, and fruit mix. The liquid spreads out as it touches the oats, creating a glossy, sticky layer on the surface, soaking into the ingredients.
Action: Pour the melted mixture over the oats, nuts, and dried fruit in the large mixing bowl *

Step 6:
Image Description: A wooden spoon is stirring the mixture in the bowl, blending the oats, nuts, and fruit with the melted syrup. The ingredients are sticking together, creating a cohesive, slightly sticky mass with an even coating of the honey-butter mixture throughout.
Action: Stir the mixture until everything is well combined *

Step 7:
Image Description: The sticky mixture is being pressed firmly into the parchment-lined baking pan, creating an even, compact layer. The surface is slightly rough with oats and nuts peeking through, but it is tightly packed to ensure it holds together when baked.
Action: Press the mixture evenly into the prepared baking pan *

Step 8:
Image Description: The baking pan with the pressed mixture sits in the center of the oven. The top of the mixture is turning a warm, golden brown, and the edges are slightly darker and crispier. The oats and nuts are lightly toasted, giving off a fragrant aroma.
Action: Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes until golden brown *

Step 9:
Image Description: The baking pan with the golden-brown mixture is resting on a cooling rack. The mixture is firm and set, with a slightly shiny surface. The texture looks crunchy around the edges while the center remains chewy. The pan is cooling, with no visible steam.
Action: Remove the baking pan from the oven and let it cool completely *

Step 10:
Image Description: The cooled mixture is being cut into neat, rectangular bars. The bars hold their shape well, with visible layers of oats, nuts, and dried fruit bound together by the honey mixture. The texture is firm but soft enough to slice cleanly.
Action: Once cooled, cut the mixture into bars *

Step 11:
Image Description: The cut bars are being placed into a clear, airtight container. The bars are neatly stacked, and their golden-brown surface contrasts with the dried fruit peeking through. The container is sealed, ready for storage at room temperature or in the fridge.
Action: Store the bars in an airtight container at room temperature or in the refrigerator *
