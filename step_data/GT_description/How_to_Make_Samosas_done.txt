Step 1:
Image Description: A mixing bowl containing two cups of fine white flour and a small pinch of salt. The ingredients are dry and evenly distributed.
Action: In a mixing bowl, combine 2 cups of flour and a pinch of salt *

Step 2:
Image Description: A steady stream of clear oil is being poured into the bowl with the flour and salt. The oil glistens as it settles into the dry mixture, creating small, shiny spots throughout the flour.
Action: Add 1/4 cup of oil to the flour mixture *

Step 3:
Image Description: Water is being added gradually to the bowl with flour, salt, and oil. Hands or a spatula are seen kneading the mixture, transforming it from dry and crumbly into a smooth, soft dough.
Action: Gradually add water to the mixture and knead into a smooth dough *

Step 4:
Image Description: The dough has been kneaded into a smooth ball and is now covered with a damp cloth. The cloth keeps the dough moist as it rests, softening and becoming more pliable.
Action: Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes *

Step 5:
Image Description: A pan with shimmering hot oil is on the stove, with cumin seeds sizzling and popping as they are added to the oil. The seeds are small, dark brown, and aromatic, releasing their flavor into the oil.
Action: In a pan, heat oil and add cumin seeds *

Step 6:
Image Description: Finely chopped onions are added to the pan with the cumin seeds. The onions are sautéing, turning soft and golden brown as they cook, blending with the aromatic cumin seeds.
Action: Add finely chopped onions and sauté until golden brown *

Step 7:
Image Description: The sautéed onions are now golden brown, and boiled, mashed potatoes are being added to the pan. The mashed potatoes are soft and fluffy, mixing into the golden onions.
Action: Add boiled, mashed potatoes to the pan *

Step 8:
Image Description: Bright green peas and fragrant spices — garam masala, turmeric, coriander powder, and salt — are being sprinkled over the potato mixture. The ingredients are mixed thoroughly, creating a colorful, aromatic filling.
Action: Add peas, garam masala, turmeric, coriander powder, and salt to taste, then mix well *

Step 9:
Image Description: The rested dough is divided into small, even-sized balls, each one smooth and firm. A rolling pin is used to flatten the dough into thin, round circles on a floured surface.
Action: Divide the dough into small balls and roll them into thin circles *

Step 10:
Image Description: Each dough circle is cut neatly in half to form two even semi-circles. The semi-circles have smooth, clean edges, ready to be shaped into cones.
Action: Cut each circle in half to form semi-circles *

Step 11:
Image Description: A semi-circle of dough is shaped into a cone, with the edges carefully pressed together. The cone holds its shape firmly.
Action: Shape each semi-circle into a cone *

Step 12:
Image Description: The potato filling is being spooned into the dough cone, filling it generously. The edges of the cone are then sealed, forming a perfect triangular samosa shape with the filling safely enclosed.
Action: Fill the cone with potato filling and seal the edges *

Step 13:
Image Description: Several stuffed and sealed samosas are lined up, ready for frying. The dough is smooth and firm, holding its shape while enclosing the savory filling.
Action: Heat oil in a deep fryer or heavy-bottomed pan *

Step 14:
Image Description: The samosas are frying in hot oil, turning golden brown and crisp as they cook. The oil bubbles around them as they float and flip, becoming perfectly crispy.
Action: Fry the samosas until they are golden brown and crispy *

Step 15:
Image Description: The fried samosas are being lifted out of the oil and placed onto paper towels to drain. The paper towels soak up the excess oil, and the samosas are golden brown and crisp.
Action: Remove samosas from oil and drain on paper towels *

Step 16:
Image Description: The golden brown, crispy samosas are served on a plate with a side of chutney or sauce. The samosas are perfectly cooked, with flaky, crisp dough and a flavorful potato filling.
Action: Serve samosas with chutney or sauce of choice *
