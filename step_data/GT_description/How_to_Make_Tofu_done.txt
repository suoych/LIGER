Step 1:
Image Description: A bowl filled with dried soybeans submerged in water. The soybeans are beginning to absorb the water, slightly expanding as they soak overnight.
Action: Soak 2 cups of dried soybeans in water overnight *

Step 2:
Image Description: The soaked soybeans are being drained and rinsed under fresh water in a colander. The soybeans are now plump and soft.
Action: Drain and rinse the soaked soybeans *

Step 3:
Image Description: The drained soybeans are placed in a blender with water. The blender is on, turning the soybeans into a smooth, frothy mixture, with no visible chunks.
Action: Blend the soybeans with 6 cups of water until smooth *

Step 4:
Image Description: The blended soybean mixture is being poured into a large pot on the stove. The mixture is beginning to heat up, and bubbles are starting to form as it approaches a boil.
Action: Pour the blended mixture into a large pot and bring to a boil *

Step 5:
Image Description: The boiled soybean mixture is being strained through a cheesecloth over a large bowl. The creamy soy milk flows through the cloth, while the remaining pulp (okara) is collected in the cheesecloth, separating the liquid from the solids.
Action: Strain the mixture through a cheesecloth to separate the soy milk from the pulp *

Step 6:
Image Description: The strained soy milk is being heated again in the pot. A thermometer shows the temperature rising to around 180°F.
Action: Heat the soy milk again until it reaches around 180°F *

Step 7:
Image Description: A coagulant, like lemon juice or nigari, is being gently stirred into the heated soy milk. The mixture begins to curdle, forming soft clumps of tofu curds as it coagulates.
Action: Add a coagulant (like lemon juice or nigari) while stirring gently to curdle the soy milk *

Step 8:
Image Description: The pot with curdled soy milk is left to sit undisturbed. The curds are solidifying, and the liquid (whey) is separating as the tofu begins to take form.
Action: Let the mixture sit undisturbed for about 20 minutes *

Step 9:
Image Description: The tofu curds are being transferred from the pot into a tofu mold lined with cheesecloth. The curds are carefully scooped in.
Action: Transfer the curds into a tofu mold lined with cheesecloth *

Step 10:
Image Description: The tofu curds are being pressed in the mold to remove excess water. A weight is placed on top, gently squeezing the curds together to form a firm, solid block of tofu.
Action: Press the curds to remove excess water and form a solid block *

Step 11:
Image Description: The tofu is removed from the mold, revealing a smooth, firm block. It is being cut into neat, even squares.
Action: Unmold the tofu and cut it into desired shapes *

Step 12:
Image Description: The tofu is now submerged in a container of water for storage, or it is ready to be used immediately in cooking. The tofu looks fresh, soft, and clean, prepared for various dishes.
Action: Store the tofu in water or use it immediately for cooking *
