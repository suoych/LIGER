Step 1:
Image Description: Four ears of sweet corn, freshly husked, with pale yellow kernels visible and silky threads removed. The corn has a glossy, firm texture, with tightly packed kernels on the cob. The corn cobs are laying side by side.
Action: Husk and clean 4 ears of sweet corn *

Step 2:
Image Description: The sweet corn cobs are now partially cut, with bright yellow kernels being carefully sliced off with a sharp knife. The kernels are falling into a bowl, separated from the cobs, and their plump, shiny texture shows their freshness. 
Action: Cut kernels off the cob *

Step 3:
Image Description: The vibrant corn kernels are inside a blender, combined with milk. The blender is in action, creating a smooth, creamy mixture as the bright yellow kernels blend into the milk. The mixture is becoming pale yellow, with a frothy texture on top as it turns smooth.
Action: Blend corn kernels with 2 cups of milk until smooth *

Step 4:
Image Description: The blended corn and milk mixture is being strained through a fine mesh sieve. A spoon or spatula is pressing the mixture through, leaving behind any remaining solids while a silky, smooth liquid collects in a bowl below. The texture is creamy and fluid, with no visible chunks or solids.
Action: Strain the mixture to remove any solids *

Step 5:
Image Description: The smooth corn and milk mixture is in a saucepan, gently heating over medium heat. Small bubbles are beginning to form around the edges of the liquid, indicating it is warming up. The mixture is still light yellow and smooth, with a slightly thickened appearance from the heat.
Action: In a saucepan, heat the mixture over medium heat *

Step 6:
Image Description: The sweetened corn mixture is being whisked as sugar is added into the saucepan. The sugar crystals dissolve quickly into the hot mixture, which becomes shinier and slightly thicker as the whisk moves through it, creating a smooth and glossy texture.
Action: Whisk in 1 cup of sugar until dissolved *

Step 7:
Image Description: Heavy cream is being poured into the sweetened corn mixture, creating a rich, creamy texture. The cream swirls into the yellow mixture, making it smoother and paler in color. A pinch of salt is also being added, with the whisk blending everything into a consistent, velvety mixture.
Action: Whisk in 1 cup of heavy cream and a pinch of salt *

Step 8:
Image Description: The mixture is being stirred constantly as it cooks, thickening gradually. Small steam wisps rise from the saucepan as the mixture becomes thicker and creamier, coating the back of a spoon with a smooth, luscious texture. The color remains a pale, creamy yellow.
Action: Cook while stirring until the mixture thickens *

Step 9:
Image Description: The thickened mixture is now cooling in the saucepan, left to reach room temperature. The creamy texture remains smooth, with no visible separation, and the mixture has a rich, custard-like consistency as it cools down.
Action: Cool the mixture to room temperature *

Step 10:
Image Description: The cooled mixture is now in a bowl, covered, and placed inside the refrigerator to chill. Condensation begins to form on the outside of the container as the mixture cools. Its texture remains smooth and creamy.
Action: Chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours *

Step 11:
Image Description: The chilled mixture is being poured into an ice cream maker. The machine is in motion, churning the mixture into a thick, creamy gelato. The pale yellow mixture is becoming thicker and more airy, with a soft, frozen texture beginning to form as it is churned.
Action: Churn in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions *

Step 12:
Image Description: The freshly churned gelato is now in a container, its texture soft and creamy. It is placed into the freezer to firm up. Once frozen, the gelato is scooped into smooth, round servings, ready to be enjoyed. The gelato looks rich and smooth, with a pale yellow hue, promising a creamy, sweet corn flavor.
Action: Freeze until firm, then serve *
