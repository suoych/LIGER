Step 1:

Image Description: A close-up of an oven control panel showing the temperature being set to 375°F (190°C), with the indicator light signaling that the oven is preheating.
Action: Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). *

Step 2:

Image Description: A smooth sheet of puff pastry being rolled out on a lightly floured surface. The pastry is thin, even, and slightly glossy from the flour dusting, with a rolling pin pressing gently over the dough.
Action: Roll out 1 sheet of puff pastry on a floured surface. *

Step 3:

Image Description: The rolled puff pastry carefully placed into a tart pan. The edges of the pastry slightly hang over the pan’s sides, with a small knife trimming the excess dough neatly along the rim.
Action: Place the puff pastry into a tart pan and trim any excess edges. *

Step 4:

Image Description: A fork pricking the bottom of the puff pastry, creating small, evenly spaced holes. The dough remains flat and smooth as the fork makes indentations.
Action: Prick the bottom of the pastry with a fork. *

Step 5:

Image Description: A piece of parchment paper is laid over the pastry in the tart pan, with pie weights or dried beans placed on top. The weights press the pastry down to prevent it from puffing up during baking.
Action: Place parchment paper over the pastry and add pie weights or dried beans to weigh it down. *

Step 6:

Image Description: The tart shell is removed from the oven, with the weights and parchment paper being lifted away, revealing a lightly golden, partially baked crust. The tart shell is then returned to the oven to finish baking to a deeper golden brown.
Action: Bake the pastry in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Remove the weights and parchment paper, and bake for another 5-10 minutes until golden brown. *

Step 7:

Image Description: A pan on the stovetop with a small pool of olive oil shimmering as it heats over medium heat.
Action: While the tart shell is baking, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a pan over medium heat. *

Step 8:

Image Description: Finely minced garlic cloves sizzling in the hot oil, releasing a fragrant aroma. The garlic begins to turn golden at the edges.
Action: Add 3-4 minced garlic cloves to the pan and cook until fragrant. *

Step 9:

Image Description: A quarter cup of balsamic vinegar is added to the pan with the garlic, creating a bubbling mixture. The liquid reduces slightly, becoming thicker and more concentrated in flavor.
Action: Add 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar to the pan and reduce slightly. *

Step 10:

Image Description: The balsamic garlic mixture is being spread evenly over the baked tart shell. The dark, glossy mixture contrasts against the golden crust, creating a flavorful base for the tart.
Action: Spread the balsamic garlic mixture over the baked tart shell evenly. *

Step 11:

Image Description: Crumbled pieces of soft, white goat cheese scattered generously over the balsamic garlic layer. The cheese is distributed evenly across the tart, ready to melt in the oven.
Action: Crumble goat cheese (approximately 150 grams) over the tart. *

Step 12:

Image Description: The tart is baking in the oven, with the goat cheese starting to melt and turn slightly golden. The edges of the cheese develop a light golden-brown hue.
Action: Bake the tart in the oven for another 15 minutes until the cheese is melted and slightly golden. *

Step 13:

Image Description: The finished tart, with its melted and slightly golden goat cheese, is removed from the oven. The tart is cooling slightly on a wire rack.
Action: Remove the tart from the oven and let it cool slightly before slicing to serve. *
