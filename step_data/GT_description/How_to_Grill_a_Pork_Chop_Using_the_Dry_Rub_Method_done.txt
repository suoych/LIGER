Step 1:
Image Description: A small bowl is filled with a mixture of brown sugar, paprika, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper.
Action: Start by preparing the dry rub. Combine the following ingredients in a small bowl: 1 tablespoon of brown sugar, 1 tablespoon of paprika, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of black pepper, 1 teaspoon of garlic powder, 1 teaspoon of onion powder, and 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. Mix well. *

Step 2:
Image Description: Raw pork chops are being patted dry with paper towels, ensuring their surface is free of moisture so the dry rub can adhere properly. The pork chops are slightly pink and well-trimmed.
Action: Take the pork chops and pat them dry with paper towels to ensure the rub adheres properly. *

Step 3:
Image Description: Each pork chop is generously coated with the prepared dry rub. The spices are pressed into the meat, covering both sides of the chops, giving them a rich, seasoned appearance.
Action: Generously coat each pork chop with the dry rub, making sure to press the spices into the meat for full flavor coverage. *

Step 4:
Image Description: The seasoned pork chops are wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and left on the counter to marinate. The spices have soaked into the meat, adding flavor during the 30-minute resting period.
Action: Cover the seasoned pork chops with plastic wrap and let them sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes to allow the flavors to penetrate the meat. *

Step 5:
Image Description: The grill is preheated to medium-high heat, showing a temperature reading of around 400°F (200°C). The grates are clean, hot.
Action: Preheat your grill to medium-high heat (about 400°F or 200°C) while the pork chops are marinating. *

Step 6:
Image Description: The seasoned pork chops are placed on the hot grill with tongs, sizzling as they sear. They are cooked evenly, turning slightly charred with clear grill marks on each side.
Action: Place the pork chops on the grill and cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, or until the internal temperature reaches 145°F (63°C). Use tongs to avoid piercing the meat and losing juices. *

Step 7:
Image Description: The grilled pork chops, now golden and juicy, are removed from the grill and resting on a plate, allowing the juices to redistribute, ensuring tender and flavorful meat.
Action: Once cooked, remove the pork chops from the grill and let them rest for 3-5 minutes before serving to allow the juices to redistribute. *
