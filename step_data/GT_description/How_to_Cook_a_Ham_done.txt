Step 1:

Image Description: A modern metal oven is slightly open with the display showing 325°F. The interior oven light softly illuminates the empty metal racks inside, indicating the oven is warming up.
Action: Preheat your oven to 325°F (165°C). *

Step 2:

Image Description: A large ham, placed fat side up, rests on a rack inside a shallow roasting pan. The meat is firm, with the fat layer visible on top, positioned perfectly for roasting.
Action: Place the ham, fat side up, on a rack in a shallow roasting pan. *

Step 3:

Image Description: The surface of the ham is carefully scored in a diamond pattern, creating deep, even cuts that crisscross across the fat. The diamonds add texture and help the glaze and cloves penetrate the meat.
Action: Score the surface of the ham in a diamond pattern. *

Step 4:

Image Description: Whole cloves are being inserted at the intersections of the scored lines. The cloves stand out like small studs, evenly spaced across the ham, ready to infuse flavor as it bakes.
Action: Insert whole cloves at the intersections of the scores. *

Step 5:

Image Description: A rich, glossy glaze is poured over the ham, covering the surface and running down into the scored lines. The glaze coats the meat with a sweet, sticky layer that will caramelize as it cooks.
Action: Pour a glaze over the ham. *

Step 6:

Image Description: The ham is loosely covered with a sheet of aluminum foil, protecting the surface while still allowing some heat to circulate. The foil is gently draped over the pan, leaving room for air to flow.
Action: Cover the ham loosely with aluminum foil. *

Step 7:

Image Description: The ham is baking in the oven, with the meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the ham. The temperature is steadily rising, approaching the target of 140°F (60°C), ensuring the ham is cooked to perfection.
Action: Bake the ham for about 15 minutes per pound, or until a meat thermometer reaches 140°F (60°C) when inserted into the thickest part. *

Step 8:

Image Description: The surface of the foil is browning beautifully in the final stages of cooking. The glaze caramelizes, creating a rich, golden-brown crust over the ham.
Action: Remove the foil during the last 30 minutes of cooking to let the ham brown. *

Step 9:

Image Description: The ham rests on a cutting board, its surface browned and glistening. Steam rises gently as it sits for 15 minutes, allowing the juices to redistribute before slicing.
Action: Let the ham rest for about 15 minutes before slicing. *
