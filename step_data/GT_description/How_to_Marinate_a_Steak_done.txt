Step 1:
Image Description: A small mixing bowl with a shallow pool of clear golden olive oil at the bottom. The oil is glossy and smooth, reflecting light slightly on its surface.
Action: In a mixing bowl, add 1/4 cup of olive oil *

Step 2:
Image Description: The mixing bowl now contains two distinct liquids: the golden olive oil on the bottom and a layer of dark brown soy sauce poured over it. The soy sauce partially mixes with the oil, creating swirling patterns.
Action: Add 1/4 cup of soy sauce *

Step 3:
Image Description: A small stream of pale yellow lemon juice is being poured into the bowl, slightly diluting the dark brown soy sauce and mixing with the golden olive oil. The liquid now has a subtle sheen, with thin streaks of lemon juice floating on top.
Action: Add 2 tablespoons of lemon juice *

Step 4:
Image Description: A thicker, dark brown Worcestershire sauce is being added to the bowl. The sauce creates a rich, almost caramel-like layer as it blends with the lemon juice, soy sauce, and olive oil. The mixture is beginning to look darker and more uniform.
Action: Add 2 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce *

Step 5:
Image Description: Finely minced garlic is sprinkled over the surface of the liquid mixture. The small white garlic pieces float slightly on top of the dark marinade, adding texture to the smooth liquid.
Action: Add 1 teaspoon of minced garlic *

Step 6:
Image Description: Fine black pepper and coarse white salt are being sprinkled into the bowl. The pepper specks and salt crystals scatter over the top of the marinade, creating a dotted appearance on the surface.
Action: Add 1 teaspoon of black pepper and 1 teaspoon of salt *

Step 7:
Image Description: Dried oregano and parsley are added to the mixture, their small green flakes resting lightly on the marinade. The herbs add a pop of color and texture, floating in the liquid and mixing with the garlic and spices.
Action: Add 1 teaspoon of dried oregano and 1 teaspoon of dried parsley *

Step 8:
Image Description: A spoon is stirring the ingredients in the bowl. The herbs, garlic, and seasonings are fully combined into the liquid, creating a smooth, dark marinade with small flecks of green and white from the spices. The texture of the liquid is thickened slightly, appearing well-blended.
Action: Mix all the ingredients thoroughly *

Step 9:
Image Description: A large resealable plastic bag is partially open, with a raw steak placed inside. The steak is thick and slightly marbled with fat, its surface pale pink and firm. The plastic bag is crinkled.
Action: Place the steak in a large resealable plastic bag *

Step 10:
Image Description: The marinade from the bowl is being poured over the steak inside the plastic bag. The dark liquid coats the surface of the steak, soaking into the meat and pooling around it at the bottom of the bag.
Action: Pour the marinade over the steak *

Step 11:
Image Description: The plastic bag is sealed tightly, with the steak submerged in the marinade. The bag is crinkled and air-tight, and the marinade surrounds the steak evenly. 
Action: Seal the bag and refrigerate for at least 2 hours *

Step 12:
Image Description: The sealed bag is now opened, and the steak is being removed from the marinade. The steak looks darker and richer in color, having absorbed the marinade. 
Action: Remove the steak from the bag and cook as desired *
