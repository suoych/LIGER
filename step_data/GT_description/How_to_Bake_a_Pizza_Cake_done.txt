Step 1:
Image Description: A sleek silver oven door, with the display showing the temperature set to 350°F. The oven racks inside are visible, clean and empty, with a soft warm light reflecting from the preheating process.
Action: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) *

Step 2:
Image Description: A smooth ball of pizza dough is being rolled out on a wooden surface dusted with flour. The dough is flattened into an even, round shape with a soft, slightly elastic texture. A rolling pin presses gently into the dough, creating a uniform thickness.
Action: Prepare your pizza dough by rolling it out on a floured surface *

Step 3:
Image Description: The rolled-out dough has been cut into neat, even circles. The edges of the dough circles are smooth, and a pizza cutter with a metal blade is visible mid-slice, with small flakes of flour clinging to the surface.
Action: Cut the dough into circles using a pizza cutter or a large cookie cutter *

Step 4:
Image Description: A single circle of dough rests perfectly in the bottom of a round metal cake pan, its surface smooth and slightly glossy from the greased pan. The dough gently hugs the sides of the pan, forming a clean base.
Action: Place one circle of dough in the bottom of a greased, round cake pan *

Step 5:
Image Description: A rich, red pizza sauce is being spooned over the dough circle, spreading smoothly in an even layer. The sauce has a thick, slightly chunky texture with visible herbs, creating a vibrant contrast against the pale dough.
Action: Spread a layer of pizza sauce over the dough *

Step 6:
Image Description: A handful of shredded mozzarella cheese is being scattered evenly over the pizza sauce. The cheese is light and fluffy, covering the sauce in a thin, even layer, with strands of white cheese curling slightly as they fall.
Action: Sprinkle a layer of shredded cheese over the sauce *

Step 7:
Image Description: A variety of toppings, such as round slices of pepperoni, green bell peppers, and mushrooms, are being added to the pizza. The toppings are colorful and neatly arranged on top of the layer of cheese, with the glossy surface of the pepperoni contrasting with the softer vegetables.
Action: Add toppings of your choice (e.g., pepperoni, vegetables) *

Step 8:
Image Description: Another dough circle is carefully laid over the toppings, its smooth surface pressing slightly against the layers beneath. A spoonful of pizza sauce is being spread on top, followed by a sprinkle of cheese and additional toppings, repeating the layers.
Action: Place another circle of dough on top and repeat the layers (sauce, cheese, toppings) *

Step 9:
Image Description: The final layer of dough is placed on top of the stacked layers, creating a smooth, even surface. Shredded cheese is sprinkled generously over the dough, forming a light, fluffy layer that covers the entire top.
Action: Finish with a final layer of dough and a sprinkling of cheese on top *

Step 10:
Image Description: The layered pizza cake is visible inside the oven, its edges turning a golden brown. The cheese on top is melting and bubbling, creating a glossy, slightly browned surface with faint steam rising from the heat.
Action: Bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes, or until the dough is golden and the cheese is bubbly *

Step 11:
Image Description: The pizza cake, now out of the oven, rests in the pan. The top is golden and crisp, with melted cheese forming a smooth, bubbly layer. Slight steam rises from the surface as it cools, the edges firm and slightly puffed.
Action: Allow the pizza cake to cool for a few minutes before slicing *

Step 12:
Image Description: A slice of the pizza cake is being lifted from the pan, revealing the layers inside. The cross-section shows alternating layers of dough, sauce, cheese, and toppings, with the melted cheese stretching slightly as the slice is pulled away. The layers are neatly stacked, and the dough appears soft yet firm.
Action: Slice and serve your pizza cake *
