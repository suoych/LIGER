Step 1:

Image Description: Several eggs are gently placed at the bottom of a saucepan or pot. The eggs sit evenly spaced, their smooth, white shells visible against the surface of the pot.
Action: Place eggs in a saucepan or pot. *

Step 2:

Image Description: The pot is being filled with cold water, covering the eggs by about an inch. The water is clear, and the eggs are fully submerged, floating slightly as the water level rises.
Action: Fill the pot with enough cold water to cover the eggs by about an inch. *

Step 3:

Image Description: The pot with the eggs and water is placed on the stove, and the heat is turned to high. Small bubbles start forming at the bottom as the water begins to heat up.
Action: Put the pot on the stove and turn the heat to high. *

Step 4:

Image Description: The water reaches a vigorous rolling boil, with large bubbles breaking the surface and steam rising from the pot. The eggs remain fully submerged as the water boils around them.
Action: Wait until the water reaches a rolling boil. *

Step 5:

Image Description: The stove is turned off, and a lid is placed securely on top of the pot, trapping the steam inside. The water stops boiling but remains hot, gently cooking the eggs.
Action: Turn off the heat and cover the pot with a lid. *

Step 6:

Image Description: The pot remains covered on the stove as the eggs sit in the hot water. No boiling is visible, but the eggs continue cooking in the residual heat, with the timer set for 9-12 minutes.
Action: Let the eggs sit in the hot water for 9-12 minutes, depending on the desired level of doneness. *

Step 7:

Image Description: The eggs are transferred into a bowl filled with ice water. The eggs cool rapidly as they sit in the ice bath, with small bubbles clinging to the surface.
Action: Remove the eggs from the hot water and place them in an ice bath to cool. *

Step 8:

Image Description: The eggs are now cool to the touch and are being carefully peeled. The smooth white shell comes off easily, revealing a perfectly cooked egg underneath.
Action: Peel the eggs once they are cool enough to handle. *
