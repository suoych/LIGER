Step 1:

Image Description: A digital oven display shows the temperature being set to 350°F (175°C), with the oven light on to indicate it is preheating.
Action: Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius). *

Step 2:

Image Description: A large mixing bowl containing three ripe bananas, with brown spots on their skins. A fork is used to mash the bananas into a smooth, creamy consistency with small lumps.
Action: In a large mixing bowl, mash 3 ripe bananas with a fork until smooth. *

Step 3:

Image Description: The mashed bananas are mixed with melted butter. The butter is a golden liquid that blends into the banana mixture, giving it a shiny, smooth appearance.
Action: Stir in 1/3 cup of melted butter. *

Step 4:

Image Description: Baking soda and a pinch of salt are sprinkled over the banana-butter mixture. The ingredients begin to blend into the creamy mixture, creating a slightly frothy texture.
Action: Mix in 1 teaspoon of baking soda and a pinch of salt. *

Step 5:

Image Description: The banana-butter mixture now has sugar, beaten egg, and vanilla extract added on top. The sugar is grainy and white, the egg adds a yellow richness, and the vanilla gives a dark amber touch to the mixture.
Action: Stir in 1 cup of sugar, 1 beaten egg, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. *

Step 6:

Image Description: All-purpose flour is gradually being stirred into the wet banana mixture. The flour lightens the color of the mixture, creating a thick batter with a smooth, pale yellow consistency.
Action: Mix in 1 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour. *

Step 7:

Image Description: The thick, banana-flavored batter is poured evenly into a greased 4x8 inch loaf pan. The batter settles smoothly, filling the pan and ready for baking.
Action: Pour the batter into a greased 4x8 inch loaf pan. *

Step 8:

Image Description: The loaf pan filled with batter is placed in the preheated oven. The top of the batter begins to rise and turn golden as it bakes. A toothpick inserted comes out clean.
Action: Bake in the preheated oven for 60-65 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. *

Step 9:

Image Description: The banana bread is cooling in the loaf pan. It is gently removed and transferred onto a wire rack to cool completely, with steam rising faintly from the warm loaf.
Action: Let the bread cool in the pan for about 10 minutes, then remove it from the pan and let it cool completely on a wire rack. *
