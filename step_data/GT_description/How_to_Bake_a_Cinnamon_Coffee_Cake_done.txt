Step 1:
Image Description: A modern metal oven is slightly open with the display showing 350°F. The interior oven light softly illuminates the empty metal racks inside, indicating the oven is warming up.
Action: Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) *

Step 2:
Image Description: A rectangular metal baking pan is being brushed with melted butter, giving it a shiny surface. A fine, white layer of flour is being sifted into the pan, evenly coating the greased interior.
Action: Grease and flour a 9x13 inch baking pan *

Step 3:
Image Description: A large mixing bowl contains a smooth, pale yellow mixture of creamed butter and sugar. The texture is soft and fluffy, with tiny air pockets visible as the ingredients are blended together.
Action: In a large bowl, cream together 1 cup of butter and 2 cups of sugar until light and fluffy *

Step 4:
Image Description: Two eggs are visible on top of the light butter-sugar mixture. One egg is half cracked with its contents being whisked into the mixture, creating a glossy sheen. The mixture is becoming slightly more yellow and smooth as the eggs are incorporated.
Action: Add 2 eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition *

Step 5:
Image Description: A small stream of dark brown vanilla extract is being poured into the creamy yellow mixture, creating subtle swirls. The texture remains soft and smooth as the extract is gently folded in.
Action: Stir in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract *

Step 6:
Image Description: A second bowl contains a pile of white flour, with smaller mounds of fine white baking powder and salt resting on top. These dry ingredients are unmixed, sitting in layers that are distinct.
Action: In another bowl, combine 3 cups of flour, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt *

Step 7:
Image Description: The dry flour mixture is being spooned into the large bowl of creamed butter, sugar, and eggs. A cup of white milk is being slowly poured into the mixture as the ingredients are gently folded together, creating a smooth, thick batter.
Action: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the creamed mixture, alternating with 1 cup of milk, beginning and ending with the dry ingredients *

Step 8:
Image Description: Half of the thick, creamy batter is being spread evenly into the greased and floured rectangular pan. The batter looks smooth, slightly glossy, and pale yellow.
Action: Pour half of the batter into the prepared baking pan *

Step 9:
Image Description: A small bowl contains light brown sugar, coarse and crumbly in texture, being mixed with a fine powder of dark cinnamon. The mixture looks slightly granular and fragrant.
Action: For the filling, in a small bowl, mix 1 cup of brown sugar and 2 tablespoons of ground cinnamon *

Step 10:
Image Description: The brown sugar and cinnamon mixture is being evenly sprinkled across the surface of the batter. The dark cinnamon mixture contrasts against the pale yellow batter, creating a speckled and textured layer.
Action: Sprinkle the filling evenly over the batter in the pan *

Step 11:
Image Description: The remaining thick batter is being carefully poured over the brown sugar filling. It is gently spread out with a spatula, fully covering the cinnamon layer beneath, creating a smooth, even top layer.
Action: Pour the remaining batter over the filling and spread it evenly *

Step 12:
Image Description: A bowl contains a crumbly mixture of light flour, golden brown sugar, and small chunks of soft butter. The mixture appears coarse and grainy, with small buttery clumps throughout.
Action: For the topping, combine 1/2 cup of flour, 1/2 cup of brown sugar, and 1/4 cup of butter until crumbly *

Step 13:
Image Description: The crumbly topping is being evenly distributed over the smooth batter. The topping looks rough and uneven, with small clumps of sugar and butter scattered across the surface.
Action: Sprinkle the topping evenly over the batter in the pan *

Step 14:
Image Description: The baking pan is placed on the center oven rack, the batter visibly rising and becoming golden brown on top. The surface of the cake shows slight cracks, and the crumbly topping has crisped up.
Action: Bake in the preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean *

Step 15:
Image Description: The cake, now golden brown and fully baked, is cooling in the pan. The crumbly topping looks crisp and firm. The surface has a rich texture with visible brown sugar crystals, and the edges have slightly pulled away from the pan.
Action: Allow the cake to cool in the pan before cutting into squares and serving *
