Step 1:
Image Description: A sleek silver oven door, with the display showing the temperature set to 350°F. The oven racks inside are visible, clean and empty, with a soft warm light reflecting from the preheating process.
Action: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) *

Step 2:
Image Description: A large mixing bowl holds a mound of soft, pale yellow butter. The butter looks smooth, creamy, and easy to work with, slightly shiny from being at room temperature.
Action: In a mixing bowl, combine 1 cup of softened butter *

Step 3:
Image Description: The bowl now contains a mixture of white granulated sugar and light brown sugar sitting on top of the softened butter. The sugar crystals are visibly distinct. As the mixture is beaten, it turns light and fluffy, with the butter blending into a creamy, pale tan color.
Action: Add 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar, then mix until creamy *

Step 4:
Image Description: Two eggs are added one by one into the creamed butter and sugar mixture. The glossy egg yolk is visible on the surface of the mixture before it is whisked in. The batter becomes smoother and slightly more liquid with each egg, turning golden yellow.
Action: Crack in 2 eggs, one at a time, mixing after each addition *

Step 5:
Image Description: A dark amber stream of vanilla extract is being poured into the smooth, creamy mixture. The vanilla creates small streaks that are quickly blended into the batter, making it slightly darker and more fragrant.
Action: Add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and mix well *

Step 6:
Image Description: In a separate bowl, the dry ingredients (white flour, baking soda, and fine salt) are being whisked together. The flour is light and powdery, while the smaller amounts of baking soda and salt are barely visible, blending into the flour as the whisk creates soft, airy peaks.
Action: In another bowl, whisk together 3 cups of flour, 1 teaspoon of baking soda, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt *

Step 7:
Image Description: The dry flour mixture is being added spoonful by spoonful to the wet ingredients in the larger mixing bowl. As the mixture is stirred together, it forms a thick, soft dough with a slightly sticky texture, the flour becoming fully incorporated.
Action: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined *

Step 8:
Image Description: The thick dough is now dotted with chocolate chips, which are being gently folded in with a spatula. The chocolate chips are semi-sweet, glistening slightly against the pale dough, and are evenly distributed throughout the mixture.
Action: Fold in 2 cups of chocolate chips (or your preferred add-ins like raisins or nuts) *

Step 9:
Image Description: Neat, rounded tablespoons of dough are being placed onto an ungreased metal baking sheet. Each mound of dough has a soft, slightly sticky appearance, with some chocolate chips visible on the surface, ready to spread and bake.
Action: Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto ungreased baking sheets *

Step 10:
Image Description: The baking sheets with mounds of dough are placed inside the oven. The cookies are rising and spreading slightly, with the edges becoming golden brown and crisp while the centers remain soft. The chocolate chips are melting slightly, creating shiny pockets on the surface.
Action: Bake in preheated oven for 10-12 minutes or until edges are golden brown *

Step 11:
Image Description: Freshly baked cookies sit on the baking sheet, their edges golden and slightly crisp while the centers are soft and slightly puffed. After a few minutes, the cookies are carefully lifted onto a metal wire cooling rack, where they continue to firm up and cool.
Action: Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely * 

Step 12:
Image Description: A plate is filled with freshly baked cookies, their golden-brown edges contrasting with the soft, chewy centers. Some of the chocolate chips have melted into the cookies, while others remain slightly firm, making them look rich and indulgent.
Action: Enjoy your freshly baked cookies or biscuits *
