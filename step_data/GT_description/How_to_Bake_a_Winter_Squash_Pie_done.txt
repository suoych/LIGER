Step 1:
Image Description: A sleek silver oven door, with the display showing the temperature set to 375°F. The oven racks inside are visible, clean and empty, with a soft warm light reflecting from the preheating process.
Action: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) *

Step 2:
Image Description: A bright orange winter squash, sliced cleanly in half, lies on a wooden cutting board. The thick flesh is smooth and firm, while the hollow center has just been cleared of seeds, leaving a slightly stringy texture around the edges.
Action: Cut a winter squash in half and remove the seeds *

Step 3:
Image Description: The two halves of the winter squash are placed face down on a metal baking sheet, their curved surfaces shiny and smooth. The edges of the squash touch the baking sheet lightly, and there’s a hint of moisture on the surface from the freshly cut interior.
Action: Place the squash halves face down on a baking sheet *

Step 4:
Image Description: The baking sheet with squash halves sits in the middle rack of the preheated oven. The outer skin of the squash is beginning to darken slightly, and steam rises faintly as the squash bakes, softening the flesh inside.
Action: Bake in the preheated oven for about 45 minutes or until the squash is soft *

Step 5:
Image Description: A spoon is used to scoop the soft, golden-orange squash flesh from the skin, leaving the shell empty. The scooped-out squash is placed in a large bowl, its texture smooth and creamy with a few small chunks still visible.
Action: Scoop out the squash flesh and place it in a large mixing bowl *

Step 6:
Image Description: The mixing bowl with squash now has a layer of fine granulated sugar, reddish-brown cinnamon, light tan ginger powder, and dark specks of nutmeg scattered on top. The spices and sugar sit unmixed on the vibrant squash flesh, creating a contrast of textures and colors.
Action: Add 1 cup of sugar, 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, 1 teaspoon of ginger, and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg *

Step 7:
Image Description: Two beaten eggs and thick, pale cream are poured into the bowl of squash and spices. The liquid ingredients begin to blend with the sugar and spices, creating a smooth, rich, and slightly frothy mixture with a light yellow-orange hue.
Action: Mix in 2 beaten eggs and 1 cup of heavy cream *

Step 8:
Image Description: The thick, creamy squash mixture is being poured into a golden, flaky pie crust. The filling spreads smoothly and evenly within the crust, filling it nearly to the edges, with a slightly glossy surface.
Action: Pour the mixture into a prepared pie crust *

Step 9:
Image Description: The pie sits in the oven, with the filling now set and slightly puffed up in the center. The surface of the pie is smooth with a golden-brown tint from the baking, and the edges of the crust are perfectly browned and crisp.
Action: Bake in the oven at 375°F for about 45 minutes or until the pie filling is set *

Step 10:
Image Description: The baked squash pie rests on a cooling rack, its surface smooth and slightly firm to the touch. The edges of the crust are golden and crisp, and the filling has a rich, deep orange color. A slight sheen remains from the natural oils in the squash and cream.
Action: Let the pie cool before serving *
