Step 1:

Image Description: A modern oven door is slightly ajar, with the digital display clearly showing “475°F (245°C).” The metal oven racks inside are illuminated by the warm glow of the interior light, signaling that the oven is preheating.
Action: Preheat the oven to 475°F (245°C). *

Step 2:

Image Description: A ball of pizza dough sits on a generously floured surface, with loose flour scattered around it. The dough has a soft, slightly elastic texture, and its surface appears smooth.
Action: Prepare pizza dough on a floured surface. *

Step 3:

Image Description: The pizza dough is rolled out into a smooth, even 12-inch circle. The edges are slightly thicker than the center, and the flour clings lightly to the dough, giving it a soft, powdery appearance.
Action: Roll out the dough into a 12-inch circle. *

Step 4:

Image Description: The rolled-out dough is carefully transferred onto a pizza stone or baking sheet. The dough’s circular shape is slightly irregular, with a soft, pliable texture resting on the hard, flat surface.
Action: Transfer the dough onto a pizza stone or baking sheet. *

Step 5:

Image Description: A ladle is spreading a thick, rich red tomato sauce over the surface of the dough. The sauce covers the dough evenly, leaving just a small border around the edges for the crust to rise and crisp during baking.
Action: Spread tomato sauce evenly over the dough. *

Step 6:

Image Description: A generous layer of shredded mozzarella cheese is sprinkled over the tomato sauce. The cheese is soft and fluffy, with some strands already beginning to melt slightly into the sauce as it sits on the dough.
Action: Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce. *

Step 7:

Image Description: Cooked meatballs, sliced in half, are evenly distributed over the cheese-covered pizza. The meatballs are browned and juicy, with their texture firm but tender, adding a hearty touch to the pizza.
Action: Add cooked meatballs sliced in half. *

Step 8:

Image Description: Fresh spinach leaves are scattered across the pizza, their vibrant green color contrasting against the rich red sauce and melted cheese. The leaves are delicate, slightly wilted, and ready to cook down in the oven’s heat.
Action: Top with fresh spinach leaves. *

Step 9:

Image Description: A light drizzle of olive oil is being applied over the pizza, giving the toppings a glossy sheen. The pizza is seasoned with a pinch of salt and a few grinds of black pepper, adding a finishing touch of flavor.
Action: Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. *

Step 10:

Image Description: The pizza is now in the preheated oven, the crust beginning to puff up and turn golden. The cheese is bubbling and melting, spreading across the surface of the pizza, while the toppings cook and blend together.
Action: Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and melted. *

Step 11:

Image Description: The baked pizza has been removed from the oven and is resting on a wooden cutting board. The crust is golden brown, the cheese is fully melted and slightly browned at the edges, and the toppings are perfectly cooked. The pizza cools slightly before being sliced.
Action: Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. *
