Step 1:

Image Description: A large pot sits on the stove with a small pool of olive oil heating over medium heat. The oil is shimmering slightly, indicating it’s hot.
Action: Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. *

Step 2:

Image Description: Minced garlic and diced onions are sizzling in the heated olive oil. The onions are softening and turning translucent, while the garlic is releasing a fragrant aroma, filling the pot with golden sautéed bits.
Action: Add minced garlic and diced onions, sauté until translucent. *

Step 3:

Image Description: Ground beef or turkey is added to the pot, cooking alongside the garlic and onions. The meat is browning evenly, with small crumbles forming as it cooks. The onions and garlic are mixing into the meat, creating a savory base.
Action: Add ground beef or turkey, and cook until browned. *

Step 4:

Image Description: A jar of marinara sauce is being poured into the pot, covering the browned meat, onions, and garlic. The rich, red sauce is stirred thoroughly, combining with the meat to form a hearty, flavorful sauce.
Action: Pour in a jar of marinara sauce and stir to combine. *

Step 5:

Image Description: Uncooked spaghetti noodles are added to the pot, with some broken in half to fit. The dry pasta rests on top of the meat sauce.
Action: Add uncooked spaghetti noodles, broken in half if necessary. *

Step 6:

Image Description: Enough water or broth is poured over the spaghetti to fully submerge the noodles. The liquid mixes with the sauce, preparing to cook the pasta directly in the flavorful mixture.
Action: Pour in enough water or broth to cover the spaghetti. *

Step 7:

Image Description: The pot has come to a rolling boil, with the spaghetti fully submerged and beginning to cook. The heat is now reduced, and the contents are simmering, allowing the pasta to absorb the sauce as it cooks.
Action: Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer. *

Step 8:

Image Description: The spaghetti and sauce are being stirred occasionally to prevent sticking. The noodles are softening, nearly al dente, and the sauce is thickening, clinging to the pasta as it cooks down.
Action: Stir occasionally and cook until the spaghetti is al dente and the sauce has thickened. *

Step 9:

Image Description: The pot is removed from heat, with the spaghetti perfectly cooked and the sauce rich and thick. The dish sits for a few minutes, allowing the flavors to settle before serving.
Action: Remove from heat, and let it sit for a few minutes before serving. *

Step 10:

Image Description: The finished spaghetti is garnished with freshly grated Parmesan cheese and a sprinkle of chopped basil. The cheese melts slightly on top of the warm pasta, while the basil adds a fresh, vibrant green accent.
Action: Garnish with grated Parmesan cheese and chopped fresh basil, if desired. *
