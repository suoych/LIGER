Step 1:
Image Description: A sleek silver oven door, with the display showing the temperature set to 350°F. The oven racks inside are visible, clean and empty, with a soft warm light reflecting from the preheating process.
Action: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) *

Step 2:
Image Description: A non-stick bundt cake pan, circular with an intricate design, is being coated with melted butter, making the surface appear shiny. A light dusting of white flour is being sprinkled inside, coating the buttered surface with a fine, powdery layer.
Action: Grease and flour a bundt cake pan *

Step 3:
Image Description: A large, transparent glass bowl contains a mixture of white sugar granules, light tan flour, dark brown cocoa powder, and small mounds of fine white powders (baking powder, baking soda, salt). Each ingredient is distinct and unmixed, creating a layered look within the bowl.
Action: In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 cups of sugar, 1 3/4 cups of flour, 3/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder, 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking soda, and 1 teaspoon of salt *

Step 4:
Image Description: Two cracked eggs are visible on top of the dry ingredients, their glossy yolks bright yellow. A stream of smooth white milk is being poured into the bowl, along with golden vegetable oil glistening on top. Dark brown drops of vanilla extract are spotted over the mix, creating a contrast with the light ingredients.
Action: Add 2 large eggs, 1 cup of whole milk, 1/2 cup of vegetable oil, and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract *

Step 5:
Image Description: A hand mixer with metal beaters is blending the contents in the bowl. The mixture is smooth and creamy, a rich chocolate color, with no dry ingredients visible. The surface of the batter has a shiny, velvety texture, with small air bubbles forming from the beating.
Action: Beat the mixture on medium speed for 2 minutes *

Step 6:
Image Description: A cup of steaming water is being poured into the bowl of chocolate batter, creating slight ripples on the surface. The batter looks glossy and thinner, with small swirls forming as the water is incorporated.
Action: Stir in 1 cup of boiling water (the batter will be thin) *

Step 7:
Image Description: The thin, rich chocolate batter is being carefully poured into the greased and floured bundt pan. The batter looks smooth and liquid, with the pan’s intricate design faintly visible beneath the dark chocolate flow.
Action: Pour the batter into the prepared bundt pan *

Step 8:
Image Description: The bundt cake pan, filled with batter, sits on the center rack inside the oven. The batter has risen, forming a smooth, rounded top that shows slight cracks as it bakes. The surface of the cake looks matte with a firm texture.
Action: Bake for 50 to 55 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean *

Step 9:
Image Description: A baked bundt cake remains in the pan, its surface showing a rich, dark chocolate color with a slightly firm texture. A faint steam rises from the cake, indicating its warmth. The edges are slightly pulling away from the pan as it cools.
Action: Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes *

Step 10:
Image Description: The bundt cake, now removed from the pan, sits perfectly on a wire cooling rack. The cake retains the intricate patterns from the bundt pan, with sharp, clean edges. The cake’s surface is a deep brown, smooth but with a soft texture visible.
Action: Invert the cake onto a wire rack to cool completely *

Step 11:
Image Description: A light dusting of fine, white powdered sugar is gently falling over the bundt cake, covering its surface and settling into the intricate grooves. Alternatively, a shiny, smooth chocolate glaze is being drizzled over the top, cascading down the sides in a glossy layer.
Action: Dust the cake with powdered sugar or drizzle with chocolate glaze before serving *
