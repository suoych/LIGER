Step 7:

Image Description: A tawa or flat skillet is heated over medium heat. The surface of the tawa begins to shimmer slightly as it warms up, ready to cook the rolled-out dough.
Action: Heat a tawa or flat skillet. *

Step 8:

Image Description: The rolled-out dough is placed onto the preheated tawa. Small bubbles start to form on the surface of the dough as it cooks, indicating itâ€™s time to flip.
Action: Place the rolled-out dough onto the tawa and cook until small bubbles appear. *

Step 9:

Image Description: The dough is flipped, revealing light golden spots on the cooked side. A spoonful of oil or ghee is applied to the surface, which starts to glisten as it soaks in.
