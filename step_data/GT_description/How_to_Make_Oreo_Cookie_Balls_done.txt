Step 1:
Image Description: Cookies are being crushed into fine crumbs. Some are processed in a food processor, while others are being crushed in a plastic bag with a rolling pin, breaking the cookies into small, even pieces.
Action: Crush 36 Oreo cookies into fine crumbs using a food processor or a plastic bag and rolling pin *

Step 2:
Image Description: The crushed Oreo crumbs are now in a mixing bowl, and softened cream cheese is being added. The dark crumbs mix with the creamy texture of the cream cheese, creating a smooth, dark chocolatey mixture as it’s blended together.
Action: In a mixing bowl, combine the Oreo crumbs with 8 oz of softened cream cheese and mix until fully combined *

Step 3:
Image Description: The Oreo and cream cheese mixture is being rolled into small, smooth balls about 1 inch in diameter. Each ball is uniform in size, dark and firm, with a dense, even texture.
Action: Roll the mixture into small balls, approximately 1-inch in diameter *

Step 4:
Image Description: The Oreo balls are lined up neatly on a baking sheet covered with wax paper. They are spaced evenly, ready to chill, and are placed into the refrigerator for cooling.
Action: Place the Oreo balls on a baking sheet lined with wax paper and refrigerate for an hour *

Step 5:
Image Description: A bowl of chocolate is being melted in the microwave. The chocolate is glossy and smooth, stirred gently to remove any lumps, creating a silky, thick liquid perfect for dipping. The chilled Oreo balls are ready nearby.
Action: Melt 16 oz of chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl, heating in 30-second intervals and stirring until smooth *

Step 6:
Image Description: Each chilled Oreo ball is being dipped into the melted chocolate using a fork, ensuring it’s fully coated. The chocolate covers the ball evenly, and it’s then carefully placed back onto the wax paper to set.
Action: Dip each Oreo ball into the melted chocolate, using a fork to fully coat, and then place back onto the wax paper *

Step 7:
Image Description: The chocolate-coated Oreo balls are placed back in the refrigerator, where they cool and harden. The chocolate sets to form a smooth, glossy shell around the Oreo balls.
Action: Refrigerate the coated Oreo balls for another hour or until chocolate is set *

Step 8:
Image Description: The fully set Oreo balls are now decorated with colorful sprinkles or a drizzle of white chocolate, adding a fun and festive touch. 
Action: Decorate with sprinkles or drizzle with white chocolate if desired, then serve or store in an airtight container *
