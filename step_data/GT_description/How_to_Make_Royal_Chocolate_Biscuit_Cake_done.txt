Step 1:
Image Description: A large bowl with digestive biscuits that have been crushed into small, uneven pieces. The biscuit crumbs vary in size, with some larger chunks mixed with finer, sandy crumbs. The texture appears rough and crumbly, with the golden-brown color of the biscuits clearly visible.
Action: Crush 300 grams of digestive biscuits into small pieces *

Step 2:
Image Description: A glass bowl placed over a pot of simmering water, containing chunks of dark chocolate. The chocolate is starting to melt, with some pieces still holding their shape while others are slowly turning into a glossy, smooth liquid. Steam rises gently around the bowl as the melting process continues.
Action: Melt 200 grams of dark chocolate in a bowl over simmering water *

Step 3:
Image Description: A bowl with fully melted dark chocolate, smooth and shiny. A block of unsalted butter, pale yellow and soft, is being added to the melted chocolate, beginning to melt around the edges as it touches the warm liquid.
Action: Add 100 grams of unsalted butter to the melted chocolate *

Step 4:
Image Description: A spatula is stirring the melted chocolate and butter together. The butter is almost completely dissolved, leaving no solid chunks, as the mixture becomes thicker and more glossy. The resulting texture is rich and smooth, with no visible separation between the ingredients.
Action: Stir until the butter is fully melted and combined with the chocolate *

Step 5:
Image Description: A stream of thick golden syrup is being poured into the glossy chocolate and butter mixture. The syrup creates shiny, viscous ribbons as it blends with the rich chocolate, adding a golden sheen to the surface of the mixture.
Action: Add 150 grams of golden syrup to the chocolate and butter mixture *

Step 6:
Image Description: The bowl, filled with the glossy, dark chocolate mixture, is removed from the heat. The mixture remains rich and smooth, with a slight sheen indicating it’s still warm. Steam is no longer rising from the bowl as it begins to cool slightly.
Action: Remove the bowl from the heat and let it cool slightly *

Step 7:
Image Description: The bowl now contains the slightly cooled chocolate mixture, and the crushed digestive biscuits are being added. The spatula stirs everything together, coating the biscuit pieces in the glossy chocolate. The once dry and crumbly biscuits now appear fully coated, creating a chunky, textured mixture.
Action: Add the crushed biscuits to the chocolate mixture and stir until well combined *

Step 8:
Image Description: A rectangular cake tin is lined with neatly cut parchment paper, the edges folded smoothly to fit the corners. The empty tin is ready to hold the chocolate-biscuit mixture, with the parchment paper prepared to help lift the cake out once set.
Action: Line a rectangular cake tin with parchment paper *

Step 9:
Image Description: The thick chocolate and biscuit mixture is being poured into the parchment-lined cake tin. A spatula is used to press the mixture down firmly, ensuring it’s packed evenly into the tin, with a smooth and flat surface formed on top.
Action: Pour the chocolate and biscuit mixture into the cake tin and press it down firmly *

Step 10:
Image Description: The filled cake tin is placed in a refrigerator. The mixture inside appears firm and compact, with a glossy top layer. The cold air in the fridge will help solidify the cake, allowing it to set properly over the next few hours.
Action: Refrigerate the cake for at least 4 hours or until set *

Step 11:
Image Description: The set chocolate biscuit cake is removed from the tin, with the parchment paper easily peeled away from the sides and bottom. The cake is firm, with a smooth surface on top, and the biscuit pieces embedded in the chocolate are visible on the sides. 
Action: Remove the cake from the tin and peel off the parchment paper before serving *
