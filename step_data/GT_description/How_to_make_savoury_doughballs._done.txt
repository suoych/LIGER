Step 1:
Image Description: A large mixing bowl with two cups of fine, white all-purpose flour. The flour is loosely piled, soft and powdery.
Action: In a mixing bowl, combine 2 cups of all-purpose flour *

Step 2:
Image Description: A teaspoon of baking powder and a small pinch of salt are added into the flour. The baking powder is a fine white powder, and the salt is in small crystals, sprinkled evenly over the flour.
Action: Add 1 teaspoon of baking powder and a pinch of salt *

Step 3:
Image Description: A whisk or spatula is mixing the flour, baking powder, and salt together in the bowl. The ingredients are blending smoothly, creating a uniform mixture of dry ingredients with no clumps.
Action: Mix the dry ingredients together *

Step 4:
Image Description: A stream of golden, melted butter is being poured into the bowl with the dry ingredients. The butter glistens as it mixes into the flour, creating small buttery streaks.
Action: Add 1/4 cup of melted butter to the dry ingredients *

Step 5:
Image Description: Warm milk is gradually poured into the bowl, mixing with the flour and butter to form a soft dough. The mixture slowly comes together, becoming thicker and smoother with each addition of milk.
Action: Stir in 3/4 cup of warm milk gradually *

Step 6:
Image Description: The dough is being kneaded by hand, becoming smooth and elastic as it’s worked. The texture is soft but stretchy, indicating it’s well-mixed and ready for resting.
Action: Knead the dough until smooth and elastic *

Step 7:
Image Description: The smooth dough is now resting under a clean cloth. The cloth is slightly damp to keep the dough from drying out as it rests and softens, preparing it for shaping.
Action: Cover the dough and let it rest for 30 minutes *

Step 8:
Image Description: The rested dough is being divided into small, evenly sized balls. Each ball is smooth and round, soft to the touch, and ready to be placed on a baking tray.
Action: Divide the dough into small balls *

Step 9:
Image Description: The dough balls are neatly arranged on a parchment-lined baking tray. They are evenly spaced apart, ensuring they will bake evenly and expand slightly in the oven.
Action: Place doughballs on a baking tray lined with parchment paper *

Step 10:
Image Description: The dough balls are now in the oven, baking at 180°C. Their surfaces are turning a light golden color, and the balls are slightly puffed, indicating they are nearly done.
Action: Bake in a preheated oven at 180°C for 15-20 minutes *

Step 11:
Image Description: The dough balls are baked to a perfect golden brown, slightly crispy on the outside but soft and warm on the inside. They are placed on a serving plate.
Action: Serve warm with a dip of your choice *
