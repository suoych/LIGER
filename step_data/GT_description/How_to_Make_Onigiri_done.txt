Step 1:
Image Description: A pot or rice cooker filled with perfectly cooked sushi rice. The rice is fluffy, white, and slightly sticky, steaming lightly.
Action: Cook 2 cups of sushi rice according to package instructions *

Step 2:
Image Description: The sushi rice is spread out on a flat surface or in a bowl, slightly cooling. The rice grains are still clinging together but are no longer steaming.
Action: Let the rice cool slightly *

Step 3:
Image Description: A pair of hands being lightly splashed with water, while a sprinkle of coarse salt is dusted over the palms. The wet hands glisten with a thin layer of water.
Action: Wet your hands with water and sprinkle them with salt *

Step 4:
Image Description: Rice is being scooped into the wet and salted hands. The rice clumps together easily, sticking to itself and forming a solid mass.
Action: Scoop about 1/2 cup of rice into your hands *

Step 5:
Image Description: The rice is being gently shaped into a compact form, either as a smooth triangle or a round ball. The hands carefully press the rice together, creating firm edges or a smooth, even surface.
Action: Shape the rice into a triangle or ball *

Step 6:
Image Description: A small indentation is being pressed into the center of the rice with a finger or thumb. A bit of tuna, pickled plum (umeboshi), or other filling is being placed into the pocket created in the rice, resting neatly inside.
Action: Make a small indentation in the center of the rice and add your desired filling (such as tuna or umeboshi) *

Step 7:
Image Description: More rice is added on top of the filling, and the hands gently press it to reform the shape of the onigiri. The filling is completely covered, and the rice looks smooth and compact once again.
Action: Cover the filling with more rice and reshape if needed *

Step 8:
Image Description: A strip of dark green nori (seaweed) is being wrapped around the onigiri. The nori sticks to the rice, creating a contrast between the smooth, white rice and the textured, shiny nori strip.
Action: Wrap a strip of nori around the onigiri *
