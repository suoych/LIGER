Step 1:
Image Description: A large pot sits on the stovetop with a small pool of golden olive oil spreading evenly across the bottom. The oil has a subtle sheen, reflecting light and gently rippling as it heats up over medium heat.
Action: Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large pot over medium heat *

Step 2:
Image Description: The pot now holds finely chopped onions, turning translucent as they cook in the heated olive oil. The onions are softening, their pale white and yellow pieces glistening as they sizzle. The oil gently bubbles around the edges of the onions, releasing a savory aroma.
Action: Add one chopped onion and cook until translucent *

Step 3:
Image Description: The onions in the pot are now fully translucent, and finely minced garlic is being added. The garlic is a pale, slightly textured addition to the soft onions, cooking quickly as the aroma intensifies. The garlic begins to soften as it blends with the onions, turning slightly golden.
Action: Add 2 cloves of minced garlic and cook for another minute *

Step 4:
Image Description: Bright red, chopped ripe tomatoes are added to the pot, filling it with vibrant color. The tomatoes are chunky, with their juices starting to mix with the softened onions and garlic. The texture is a combination of smooth and juicy, with visible seeds and tomato skins.
Action: Add 4 cups of chopped ripe tomatoes *

Step 5:
Image Description: A steady stream of clear broth (either chicken or vegetable) is being poured into the pot, covering the tomato mixture. The liquid begins to mix with the softened tomatoes, onions, and garlic, creating a rich, colorful base for the soup. The tomatoes start to break down as they simmer in the broth.
Action: Pour in 4 cups of chicken or vegetable broth *

Step 6:
Image Description: The pot is now bubbling gently as the soup reaches a boil. After boiling, the heat is reduced, and the tomato mixture simmers steadily. The ingredients blend together, with the tomatoes breaking down further, creating a thick, slightly chunky soup consistency.
Action: Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes *

Step 7:
Image Description: A hand-held immersion blender is immersed in the simmering pot, blending the soup until smooth. The mixture turns from a chunky, textured blend of tomatoes, onions, and broth into a velvety, bright red puree. No solid chunks remain, and the soup takes on a silky consistency.
Action: Use a blender to puree the soup until smooth *

Step 8:
Image Description: Thick, white heavy cream is being poured into the pot of smooth tomato soup. The cream swirls into the bright red puree, creating a marbled effect before fully incorporating. The texture of the soup becomes even smoother, turning a soft, creamy orange color.
Action: Stir in 1 cup of heavy cream *

Step 9:
Image Description: The now creamy tomato soup is being seasoned with freshly ground salt and pepper. The small flecks of pepper and salt dissolve into the smooth surface, subtly enhancing the flavor without altering the creamy, consistent texture of the soup.
Action: Season with salt and pepper to taste *

Step 10:
Image Description: The creamy tomato soup is ladled into bowls, steaming hot. It is garnished with a bright green sprig of fresh basil or golden, crispy croutons placed gently on the surface. The garnish adds texture and contrast to the velvety smooth soup.
Action: Serve hot with a garnish of fresh basil or croutons *
