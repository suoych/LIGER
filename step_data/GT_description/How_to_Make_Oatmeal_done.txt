Step 1:
Image Description: A shiny silver pot sits on the stove with water or milk inside, beginning to bubble and steam. The liquid is clear if it’s water or creamy white if it’s milk, with the surface rippling as the heat intensifies, nearing a full boil.
Action: In a pot, bring 2 cups of water or milk to a boil *

Step 2:
Image Description: As the liquid reaches a rolling boil, oats is being poured into the pot. The oats are light brown and slightly textured, scattering across the bubbling water or milk as they sink into the boiling liquid.
Action: Add 1 cup of oats *

Step 3:
Image Description: The heat has been reduced, and the oats are now gently simmering in the pot. A spoon is stirring the mixture, ensuring the oats are evenly cooking. The oats are starting to expand, softening as they absorb the water or milk, creating a creamy texture.
Action: Reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally *

Step 4:
Image Description: The oats are now fully simmering in the pot, thickening into a soft, creamy consistency. Bubbles occasionally rise to the surface, and the oats look plump and well-cooked. The liquid has been mostly absorbed, and the mixture is becoming smoother.
Action: Cook for about 5-7 minutes or until the oats are soft *

Step 5:
Image Description: The pot has been removed from the heat, and the oatmeal rests, thickening slightly as it sits. The surface of the oatmeal is smooth and creamy, with steam still rising.
Action: Remove from heat and let it sit for a minute *

Step 6:
Image Description: The cooked oatmeal is now served in a bowl, with the creamy oats filling the bowl almost to the top. Fresh fruits, crunchy nuts, and a drizzle of golden honey are being added as toppings, making the oatmeal look colorful and inviting.
Action: Serve the oatmeal in a bowl and add your favorite toppings like fruits, nuts, or honey *
