Step 1:
Image Description: A large mixing bowl containing fine, white sweet rice flour and a small amount of salt. The flour has a soft, powdery texture, while the salt is barely visible, blending seamlessly with the flour. 
Action: In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 cups of sweet rice flour and 1/4 teaspoon of salt *

Step 2:
Image Description: Water is being gradually poured into the bowl with the sweet rice flour and salt. A spoon or whisk is stirring the mixture continuously, and the water starts to blend with the flour, creating a thick, lumpy batter that is slowly becoming smoother with each stir.
Action: Gradually add 1 and 3/4 cups of water while stirring the mixture continuously *

Step 3:
Image Description: The batter is now smooth, with no visible lumps, resembling a thick, creamy liquid. The spoon or whisk is gliding easily through the mixture, which has a glossy, even texture. The consistency is perfect for steaming.
Action: Mix until the batter is smooth and has no lumps *

Step 4:
Image Description: A round or square steaming dish is being lightly coated with a thin layer of cooking oil. The oil glistens on the surface of the dish.
Action: Grease a steaming dish with some cooking oil *

Step 5:
Image Description: The smooth, white batter is being poured into the greased steaming dish. The batter spreads evenly across the surface of the dish, settling into a uniform layer.
Action: Pour the batter into the greased steaming dish *

Step 6:
Image Description: The steaming dish with the batter inside is placed carefully into a steamer. Steam rises from the bottom of the pot, and the lid is being placed on top to trap the heat. The batter is now steaming, gradually transforming into a firm cake.
Action: Place the dish into a steamer and steam for about 30-40 minutes on medium heat *

Step 7:
Image Description: The lid of the steamer is lifted, and a toothpick is inserted into the center of the steamed cake. The toothpick comes out clean, indicating that the cake is fully cooked. The surface of the cake is smooth, slightly glossy, and firm to the touch.
Action: Check if the cake is done by inserting a toothpick; it should come out clean *

Step 8:
Image Description: The steaming dish with the firm rice cake is being removed from the steamer. The cake is slightly glossy and smooth, with no cracks. It is left to cool at room temperature, gradually firming up as it cools down completely.
Action: Remove the dish from the steamer and let the cake cool completely *

Step 9:
Image Description: The cooled rice cake is being cut into small pieces. The texture is soft but firm, holding its shape well. Optional garnishes like powdered sugar or coconut flakes are lightly dusted on top, adding a touch of sweetness and texture to the simple, clean look of the cake.
Action: Once cooled, cut the cake into small pieces and optionally dust with some powdered sugar or coconut flakes for garnish *

Step 10:
