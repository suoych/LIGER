Step 1:
Image Description: A block of tofu is being pressed between two flat surfaces, with a cloth or paper towels wrapped around it to absorb excess moisture. The tofu looks firm and pale, while the towels are slightly damp from soaking up the liquid.
Action: Drain and press the tofu to remove excess moisture *

Step 2:
Image Description: The pressed tofu block is being cut into even cubes or slices. The tofu pieces are smooth and firm, with clean edges and a pale white color, neatly arranged on a cutting board.
Action: Cut the tofu into cubes or slices *

Step 3:
Image Description: A bowl contains a dark, thin soy sauce base, with finely minced garlic and freshly grated ginger floating on top. The garlic and ginger are small, slightly textured pieces, mixing with the smooth liquid marinade.
Action: In a bowl, combine soy sauce, minced garlic, and grated ginger *

Step 4:
Image Description: A small stream of golden sesame oil and a drizzle of sticky maple syrup or honey are being poured into the marinade. The oil creates a glossy sheen on the surface of the dark soy sauce mixture, while the syrup or honey swirls in, thickening the marinade slightly.
Action: Add sesame oil and a bit of maple syrup or honey *

Step 5:
Image Description: The tofu cubes or slices are placed gently into the bowl of marinade. The tofu pieces are partially submerged in the dark liquid.
Action: Place the tofu cubes or slices into the bowl with the marinade *

Step 6:
Image Description: The tofu is being gently tossed in the bowl, fully coated in the glossy marinade. Each piece is soaking up the dark sauce, and the garlic and ginger bits cling to the surface of the tofu. 
Action: Toss gently to coat all pieces and marinate for at least 30 minutes *

Step 7:
Image Description: The marinated tofu pieces are being removed from the bowl, their surfaces glistening with the sauce. The tofu has absorbed the marinade, taking on a slightly darker hue and appearing ready for cooking.
Action: Remove tofu from marinade and cook as desired *
