Step 1:
Image Description: In a large mixing bowl, all-purpose flour is being poured over water. The flour is soft and powdery, while the water is clear and slightly splashing as it mixes with the flour. The two ingredients sit together.
Action: In a large mixing bowl, combine 1 cup of all-purpose flour and 1/2 cup of water *

Step 2:
Image Description: A small cup of clear, light golden dashi stock is being poured into the flour and water mixture. The dashi slightly darkens the mixture, and you can see the thin liquid starting to spread throughout the flour.
Action: Add 1/4 cup of dashi stock to the bowl *

Step 3:
Image Description: A large egg is cracked open above the bowl, its contents falling into the flour, water, and dashi mixture. The yolk remains whole and bright yellow, sitting on top of the other ingredients, while the egg white slowly spreads out.
Action: Crack 1 large egg into the mixture *

Step 4:
Image Description: A spoon is stirring the mixture, blending the flour, water, dashi, and egg together. The batter becomes smooth and creamy, with a pale yellow color and a slightly thick consistency.
Action: Stir to combine until smooth *

Step 5:
Image Description: Finely chopped cabbage is being added to the smooth batter. The cabbage is pale green with crisp edges, blending into the thick batter, creating texture and volume.
Action: Add 1 cup of finely chopped cabbage *

Step 6:
Image Description: Thinly sliced green onions are being mixed into the batter. The vibrant green onions contrast against the pale batter, adding color and a subtle fresh flavor.
Action: Mix in 1/4 cup of thinly sliced green onions *

Step 7:
Image Description: Julienned carrots and tempura scraps are added to the batter. The thin orange strips of carrot and crunchy golden tempura scraps bring additional texture and a bright color to the mixture.
Action: Add 1/4 cup of julienned carrots and 1/4 cup of tempura scraps (if available) *

Step 8:
Image Description: A non-stick skillet is being lightly greased with oil. The skillet sits on the stove, heating up over medium heat, with the oil glistening across the surface.
Action: Grease a non-stick skillet and heat it over medium heat *

Step 9:
Image Description: Half of the batter is poured into the skillet. The thick mixture spreads out evenly across the hot surface, with chunks of cabbage, green onions, and carrots visible, forming a round pancake shape.
Action: Pour half of the batter into the skillet and spread it out evenly *

Step 10:
Image Description: The okonomiyaki is cooking in the skillet, and the bottom is turning golden brown. The edges are slightly crisping, and small bubbles form in the batter as it cooks evenly across the surface.
Action: Cook for about 3-4 minutes until the bottom is golden brown *

Step 11:
Image Description: The okonomiyaki is flipped over in the skillet, revealing a perfectly golden-brown surface on the cooked side. The other side is now cooking, and the ingredients are melding together in the heat.
Action: Flip the okonomiyaki and cook the other side for another 3-4 minutes *

Step 12:
Image Description: The fully cooked okonomiyaki is being lifted from the skillet and placed on a serving plate. The pancake is round, golden brown, and filled with visible pieces of cabbage, carrots, and green onions.
Action: Remove the okonomiyaki from the skillet and place it on a serving plate *

Step 13:
Image Description: A thick drizzle of okonomiyaki sauce is being poured across the surface of the pancake. The dark, tangy sauce creates a glossy finish and spreads out in wavy lines on top of the okonomiyaki.
Action: Drizzle okonomiyaki sauce on top *

Step 14:
Image Description: Japanese mayonnaise is being drizzled over the okonomiyaki sauce in thin white lines. The creamy texture of the mayonnaise contrasts with the rich sauce, creating a traditional decorative pattern.
Action: Drizzle Japanese mayonnaise over the sauce *

Step 15:
Image Description: A sprinkle of dried seaweed (aonori) and delicate bonito flakes (katsuobushi) are added on top of the okonomiyaki. The seaweed is dark green and finely ground, while the bonito flakes are light and wispy, slightly moving from the heat.
Action: Sprinkle with dried seaweed (aonori) and bonito flakes (katsuobushi) *

Step 16:
Image Description: The fully garnished okonomiyaki sits on the plate, hot and ready to be served. The toppings of sauce, mayonnaise, seaweed, and bonito flakes complete the dish.
