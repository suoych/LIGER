Action: In a separate bowl, dissolve 1 tablespoon of yeast and 1.5 tablespoons of sugar in 1.25 cups of warm water; let it sit until foamy. *

Step 3:

Image Description: The foamy yeast mixture is poured into the large bowl with the flour and salt. The liquid begins to combine with the dry ingredients, preparing to form the dough.
Action: Pour the yeast mixture into the flour mixture. *

Step 4:

Image Description: The mixture is stirred, gradually forming a sticky dough as the ingredients come together. The dough begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl.
Action: Stir the mixture until it forms a dough. *

Step 5:

Image Description: The dough is placed on a floured surface and kneaded. The dough becomes smooth and elastic, transforming from a rough mixture to a pliable, cohesive mass.
Action: Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 10 minutes. *

Step 6:

Image Description: The kneaded dough is placed in a lightly oiled bowl and covered with a damp cloth. It begins to rise, doubling in size.
Action: Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with a damp cloth; let it rise for 1 hour. *

Step 7:

Image Description: The risen dough is punched down to release the air bubbles and then divided into 8 equal pieces. Each piece is soft.
Action: Punch down the dough and divide it into 8 equal pieces. *

Step 8:

Image Description: Each of the 8 pieces of dough is rolled into a smooth ball, creating uniform shapes, ready to be formed into bagels.
Action: Shape each piece into a ball. *

Step 9:

Image Description: A hole is poked in the center of each dough ball, and the dough is gently stretched to form a bagel shape, with a distinctive ring in the middle.
Action: Poke a hole in the center of each ball and gently stretch it to form a bagel shape. *

Step 10:

Image Description: The oven is preheated to 425째F (218째C), with the temperature gauge showing the heat rising, preparing for the baking step.
Action: Preheat your oven to 425째F (218째C). *

Step 11:

Image Description: A large pot of water is brought to a rolling boil on the stove, and 1 tablespoon of sugar is added to the water, preparing it for boiling the bagels.
Action: Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add 1 tablespoon of sugar. *

Step 12:

Image Description: The raw bagels are carefully dropped into the boiling water. They float to the top. They become slightly puffed.
Action: Drop each bagel into the boiling water; boil for 1-2 minutes on each side. *

Step 13:

Image Description: The boiled bagels are removed from the water and placed on a baking sheet. Their surface is smooth and wet, ready for baking.
Action: Remove the bagels from the water and place them on a baking sheet. *

Step 14:

Image Description: Each bagel is brushed with an egg wash, creating a shiny surface. Toppings like sesame seeds or poppy seeds are sprinkled on top, adding texture and flavor.
Action: Brush each bagel with an egg wash and sprinkle with toppings if desired. *

Step 15:

Image Description: The bagels are placed in the preheated oven, where they bake. The tops turn golden brown, and the bagels develop a chewy, crisp crust.
Action: Bake the bagels for 20-25 minutes, until golden brown. *

Step 16:

Image Description: The baked bagels are removed from the oven, golden brown and crisp. They cool on a wire rack.
Action: Remove the bagels from the oven and let cool on a wire rack before serving. *
