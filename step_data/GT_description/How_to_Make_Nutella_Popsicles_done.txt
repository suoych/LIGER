Step 1:

Image Description: Three key ingredients are laid out neatly on a countertop: a jar of glossy, dark brown Nutella, a carton of milk with condensation droplets on the surface, and empty popsicle molds. The molds are sleek and transparent.
Action: Gather your ingredients - Nutella, milk, and popsicle molds *

Step 2:

Image Description: In a medium-sized mixing bowl, milk is being poured over a rich, glossy scoop of Nutella. The Nutella is thick and creamy, slightly sticking to the sides of the bowl, while the milk, pale and smooth.
Action: In a mixing bowl, combine 1 cup of milk and 1/3 cup of Nutella *

Step 3:

Step 5:

Image Description: Popsicle sticks are being inserted into the molds, each one centered neatly within the thick Nutella mixture. The sticks stand upright in the smooth liquid.
Action: Insert popsicle sticks into the molds *

Step 6:

Image Description: The popsicle molds are placed inside the freezer. The Nutella mixture is still glossy and liquid inside the molds, and the cold air from the freezer begins to condense on the moldsâ€™ surface.
Action: Place the molds in the freezer for at least 4-6 hours, or until fully frozen *

Step 7:

Image Description: A hand gently pulls a popsicle out from the mold. The popsicle is fully frozen, smooth, and shiny, with a dark chocolate-brown color. The surface of the popsicle is slightly frosted from the freezer.
Action: Remove the popsicles from the molds and enjoy *
