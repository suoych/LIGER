Step 1:
Image Description: A large mixing bowl contains all-purpose flour and salt. The dry ingredients are lightly stirred together, creating a smooth, pale mixture.
Action: In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 cups of all-purpose flour and 1/2 teaspoon of salt *

Step 2:
Image Description: Water is being gradually poured into the bowl of flour and salt while a spoon stirs the mixture. The dough starts to form, slightly sticky and coming together as the water is incorporated.
Action: Gradually add 3/4 cup of water while stirring until a dough forms *

Step 3:
Image Description: The dough is kneaded on a floured surface. Hands work the dough, pressing and folding it repeatedly until it becomes smooth and elastic, ready for resting.
Action: Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 8-10 minutes until smooth *

Step 4:
Image Description: The smooth dough is covered with a damp cloth, resting on the floured surface. It sits undisturbed, allowing the gluten to relax, preparing it for rolling.
Action: Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for at least 30 minutes *

Step 5:
Image Description: In a separate bowl, ground pork, finely chopped Napa cabbage, soy sauce, sesame oil, and chopped green onions are mixed together. The ingredients combine into a flavorful filling mixture.
Action: In another bowl, combine 1/2 pound of ground pork, 1 cup of finely chopped Napa cabbage, 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of sesame oil, and 2 chopped green onions *

Step 6:
Image Description: The rested dough is rolled into a long, even log on the floured surface. A knife cuts the dough into small, uniform pieces.
Action: Roll the dough into a long log and cut into small pieces *

Step 7:
Image Description: Each small piece of dough is rolled into a thin circle using a rolling pin. The circles are smooth and delicate.
Action: Roll each piece into a thin circle using a rolling pin *

Step 8:
Image Description: A small spoonful of the pork and cabbage filling is placed in the center of each thin dough circle. The filling is evenly distributed.
Action: Place a small spoonful of filling into the center of each circle *

Step 9:
Image Description: The dough is folded over the filling, creating a half-moon shape. The edges are pinched together tightly to seal the dumplings, forming pleats for extra security.
Action: Fold the dough over the filling and pinch the edges to seal *

Step 10:
Image Description: A large pot of water is boiling, and the sealed dumplings are being added. They begin to cook, sinking at first before starting to float as they near readiness.
Action: Boil water in a large pot, then add dumplings and cook until they float *

Step 11:
Image Description: The dumplings float to the surface of the boiling water, indicating they are fully cooked. A slotted spoon lifts the dumplings out of the pot, ready to be served hot.
Action: Remove the cooked dumplings with a slotted spoon and serve hot *
