Step 1:
Image Description: A sleek silver oven door, with the display showing the temperature set to 425°F. The oven racks inside are visible, clean and empty, with a soft warm light reflecting from the preheating process.
Action: Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C) *

Step 2:
Image Description: A large rectangular baking sheet is lined with shiny aluminum foil, smoothly fitted to the edges. Alternatively, the parchment paper option is crisp, slightly folded around the corners, providing a non-stick surface for baking.
Action: Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper *

Step 3:
Image Description: Several raw chicken thighs with pale pink skin are being patted dry with a paper towel. The skin becomes slightly matte as the moisture is absorbed, leaving the chicken ready for seasoning and oil.
Action: Pat the chicken thighs dry with paper towels *

Step 4:
Image Description: The chicken thighs are arranged evenly on the lined baking sheet, their skin smooth and firm. There’s space between each piece, allowing for even baking. The pale color of the raw chicken contrasts with the shiny aluminum foil or parchment.
Action: Place the chicken thighs on the lined baking sheet *

Step 5:
Image Description: A stream of golden olive oil is being drizzled over the chicken thighs. The oil glistens as it coats the surface of each piece, and hands rub the oil in to ensure the chicken is fully covered, giving the skin a glossy, slightly slick texture.
Action: Drizzle olive oil over the chicken thighs and rub to coat each piece *

Step 6:
Image Description: Coarse salt, freshly cracked black pepper, and a sprinkle of herbs (such as rosemary, thyme, or paprika) are evenly scattered over the oiled chicken thighs. The seasoning clings to the glossy surface, creating a colorful and textured layer over the skin.
Action: Season the chicken thighs with salt, pepper, and your favorite herbs or spices *

Step 7:
Image Description: The baking sheet with the seasoned chicken thighs is being carefully slid into the center rack of the preheated oven. The chicken is positioned evenly on the tray, ready to bake, with the oven’s light reflecting off the seasoned oil on the skin.
Action: Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven *

Step 8:
Image Description: Inside the oven, the chicken thighs are sizzling and turning golden brown. The skin has crisped up, with slight bubbling from the fat and oil, while the edges are a deeper golden-brown. The meat is fully cooked, with juices visible at the bottom of the tray.
Action: Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C) and the skin is crispy *

Step 9:
Image Description: The baking sheet with perfectly roasted chicken thighs is being removed. The skin is golden and crisp, with a slight sheen from the olive oil. The chicken rests on the tray, steam rising gently as the juices redistribute inside, ensuring a tender bite.
Action: Remove the chicken thighs from the oven and let them rest for 5 minutes before serving *
