Step 1:
Image Description: A large pot is filled with bright yellow corn kernels. The kernels are plump and glossy, sitting at the bottom of the pot, evenly spread. The pot is clean and metallic, and the kernelsâ€™ fresh, firm texture contrasts with the smooth surface of the pot.
Action: In a large pot, add 2 cups of corn kernels *

Step 2:
Image Description: Clear liquid, either water or light vegetable broth, is being poured into the pot, covering the corn kernels. The liquid starts to fill the spaces between the kernels, creating a gentle, swirling motion. The kernels begin to float slightly in the pot as the liquid level rises.
Action: Pour in 4 cups of water or vegetable broth *

Step 3:
Image Description: The pot is now on the stove, and the liquid and corn mixture is coming to a rolling boil. Bubbles rise vigorously from the surface, and the corn kernels are gently moving within the boiling liquid. Steam rises from the pot, and the mixture becomes lively and energetic as it boils.
Action: Bring the mixture to a boil *

Step 4:
Image Description: The boiling mixture has now calmed down to a simmer after the heat has been reduced. Small bubbles gently break the surface, and the corn kernels are softening, absorbing the liquid as they cook. The steam continues to rise in soft, wispy trails from the pot.
Action: Reduce the heat and let it simmer for 10-15 minutes *

Step 5:
Image Description: An immersion blender is in the pot, blending the softened corn and liquid into a smooth puree. The mixture transforms from chunky and liquid-filled to a thick, smooth consistency, with no visible corn kernels remaining. The yellow color deepens as the puree becomes creamy.
Action: Use an immersion blender to puree the mixture until smooth *

Step 6:
Image Description: Thick cream is being poured into the pureed corn mixture. The cream swirls into the vibrant yellow soup, lightening the color and adding richness. A sprinkle of salt and freshly ground black pepper is also being added, mixing into the creamy soup.
Action: Add 1/2 cup of cream, salt, and pepper to taste *

Step 7:
Image Description: The creamy corn soup is being stirred well, blending the cream and seasonings fully into the mixture. The texture is smooth and velvety, and the soup simmers gently, with small bubbles occasionally rising to the surface as it thickens slightly.
Action: Stir well and let it simmer for another 5 minutes *

Step 8:
Image Description: The hot, creamy corn soup is being served in a bowl, its surface smooth and shiny. Freshly chopped cilantro or green onions are sprinkled on top as a garnish, adding a pop of green color and a fresh aroma. The soup looks warm and inviting.
Action: Serve hot, garnished with chopped cilantro or green onions *
