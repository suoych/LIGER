Step 1:
Image Description: A fresh, raw white fish fillet is being patted dry with paper towels. The fish has a smooth, moist surface, which is now being gently dried to prepare for seasoning. The fillet looks firm and clean.
Action: Pat the white fish dry with paper towels *

Step 2:
Image Description: The fish fillet is evenly seasoned with a light sprinkling of coarse salt and freshly cracked black pepper on both sides. The seasoning creates a subtle texture on the smooth surface of the fish.
Action: Season the fish with salt and pepper on both sides *

Step 3:
Image Description: A skillet is heating up over medium-high heat, with a small amount of oil shimmering across the surface. The oil spreads into a thin, glossy layer.
Action: Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat *

Step 4:
Image Description: The seasoned white fish fillet is gently placed into the hot skillet, skin-side down if applicable. The fish begins to sizzle upon contact, and the edges start to turn a light golden brown as it cooks.
Action: Carefully place the fish into the skillet, skin-side down if applicable *

Step 5:
Image Description: The fish is cooking on one side, developing a beautiful golden brown crust. The edges of the fillet are crisping slightly, and the fish is becoming opaque as it cooks through.
Action: Cook the fish for 3-4 minutes on one side until golden brown *

Step 6:
Image Description: The fish is flipped over with a spatula, revealing the golden brown, crispy skin or seared surface on the first side. The other side is now cooking, and the fish is becoming fully opaque and flaking easily with a fork.
Action: Flip the fish over and cook for another 3-4 minutes until fully cooked and flakes easily with a fork *

Step 7:
Image Description: The fully cooked fish fillet is lifted from the skillet and placed onto a plate lined with paper towels. The fish looks perfectly cooked, with a crispy golden brown exterior, while the paper towel absorbs any excess oil.
Action: Remove the fish from the skillet and place on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil *

Step 8:
Image Description: The cooked fish fillet is served on a plate, accompanied by fresh lemon wedges and garnished with a sprinkling of green herbs. The lemon wedges are bright yellow and juicy, ready to be squeezed over the fish for added freshness.
Action: Serve the fish with lemon wedges and garnish with fresh herbs if desired *
