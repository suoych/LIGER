Step 1:

Image Description: A non-stick skillet is heating over medium heat, with a small amount of butter or oil melting and spreading across the surface. The butter is beginning to sizzle slightly, creating a glossy, even coating on the pan.
Action: Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and add a small amount of butter or oil. *

Step 2:

Image Description: In a mixing bowl, 2-3 eggs are whisked together with a pinch of salt and pepper. The eggs have a frothy, smooth consistency, with small air bubbles forming on the surface as they’re whisked.
Action: In a bowl, whisk together 2-3 eggs, salt, and pepper. *

Step 3:

Image Description: The whisked egg mixture is being poured into the hot skillet. The eggs spread evenly across the pan, immediately starting to cook around the edges as they meet the heat.
Action: Pour the egg mixture into the skillet. *

Step 4:

Image Description: Using a spatula, the eggs are gently stirred, creating soft folds in the partially cooked mixture. The edges are beginning to set while the center remains slightly runny, creating soft, creamy curds.
Action: Gently stir the eggs using a spatula, just until they begin to set. *

Step 5:

Image Description: The eggs are now evenly spread across the skillet, forming a smooth, even layer. The omelet is no longer being stirred, allowing the eggs to firm up as they cook without any further movement.
Action: Spread the eggs evenly across the skillet and let them cook without stirring. *

Step 6:

Image Description: A variety of fillings, such as shredded cheese, diced ham, and sautéed vegetables, are being sprinkled over one half of the omelet. The ingredients are spread generously, ready to melt and combine with the eggs.
Action: Add fillings like cheese, ham, vegetables, etc., over one half of the omelet. *

Step 7:

Image Description: Using a spatula, the omelet is carefully folded in half. The eggs are golden and soft, enveloping the fillings as the omelet takes on its classic half-moon shape in the skillet.
Action: Carefully fold the omelet in half using the spatula. *

Step 8:

Image Description: The folded omelet is cooking for an additional 1-2 minutes, allowing the cheese to melt and the fillings to warm through. The edges of the omelet are golden, while the inside is fully cooked and steamy.
Action: Cook for another 1-2 minutes until the fillings are warmed and the eggs are fully cooked. *

Step 9:

Image Description: The fully cooked omelet is being slid out of the skillet onto a plate. The omelet is golden on the outside, with the melted cheese and fillings peeking out slightly from the folded center.
Action: Slide the omelet onto a plate and serve immediately. *
