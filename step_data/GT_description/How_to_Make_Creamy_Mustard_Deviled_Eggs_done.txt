Step 1:
Image Description: A stainless steel pot sits on the stovetop with six eggs fully submerged in boiling water. The smooth, pale eggshells are visible beneath the bubbling water, as small air bubbles cling to the sides of the eggs, indicating they are cooking. Steam gently rises from the pot.
Action: Boil 6 eggs until hard-boiled *

Step 2:
Image Description: A pot of hot water with six hard-boiled eggs is shown. The eggs have been removed and are now placed in a separate bowl of ice water. The ice cubes float, cooling the eggs, whose shells are slightly wet and speckled with moisture. Some shells are starting to crack, preparing for peeling.
Action: Cool and peel the eggs *

Step 3:
Image Description: Six peeled hard-boiled eggs are placed on a cutting board, their smooth white surfaces glistening slightly. A knife is cutting through one egg lengthwise, revealing the bright yellow yolk in the center, contrasting with the clean, white egg whites.
Action: Cut the eggs in half lengthwise *

Step 4:
Image Description: The halved eggs are arranged neatly, with their bright yellow yolks exposed. A small spoon is scooping out one of the yolks, leaving a smooth, rounded hollow in the white half-egg. The collected yolks are being placed into a mixing bowl nearby.
Action: Scoop out the yolks and place them in a mixing bowl *

Step 5:
Image Description: A close-up of a fork mashing the golden yellow egg yolks in a mixing bowl. The yolks crumble into smaller pieces under the pressure of the fork, forming a coarse, powdery texture with tiny lumps.
Action: Mash the yolks with a fork *

Step 6:
Image Description: Thick, creamy mayonnaise is being added to the mashed yolks. The mayonnaise is smooth and pale, pooling in the center of the crumbly yolks.
Action: Add 1/4 cup of mayonnaise *

Step 7:
Image Description: Bright yellow mustard is being poured into the bowl with the yolks and mayonnaise. The mustard forms a bold, glossy streak across the creamy mayonnaise and mashed yolks, contrasting in texture and color.
Action: Add 1 tablespoon of mustard *

Step 8:
Image Description: A spoon is stirring the mayonnaise, mustard, and yolks together in the bowl. The mixture is becoming smooth and creamy, with the pale yellow color blending evenly throughout. The texture is now soft and silky, without any visible lumps.
Action: Stir until the mixture is smooth and creamy *

Step 9:
Image Description: A spoon or piping bag is shown carefully filling the hollowed-out egg white halves with the smooth, creamy yolk mixture. The filling is soft and perfectly shaped, rising slightly above the edges of the egg whites, creating a neat, uniform appearance.
Action: Spoon or pipe the yolk mixture back into the egg whites *

Step 10:
Image Description: The deviled eggs are garnished with a light sprinkle of bright red paprika or finely chopped green chives. The colorful garnish adds texture and visual contrast to the smooth, creamy yolk filling and the white egg surface.
Action: Garnish with a sprinkle of paprika or chopped chives *

Step 11:
Image Description: The finished deviled eggs are arranged on a serving platter, looking perfectly creamy and garnished. The soft yolk mixture contrasts with the crisp garnish, inviting the viewer to take one.
Action: Serve and enjoy *
